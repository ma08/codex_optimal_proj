# Write Number in Expanded Form - Part 2

This is version 2 of my ['Write Number in Exanded Form' Kata](https://www.codewars.com/kata/write-number-in-expanded-form).

You will be given a number and you will need to return it as a string in [Expanded Form](https://www.mathplacementreview.com/arithmetic/decimals.php#writing-a-decimal-in-expanded-form). For example:

```python
expanded_form(1.24) # Should return '1 + 2/10 + 4/100'
expanded_form(7.304) # Should return '7 + 3/10 + 4/1000'
expanded_form(0.04) # Should return '4/100'
```
