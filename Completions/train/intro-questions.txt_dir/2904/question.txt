Write a function taking in a string like `WOW this is REALLY          amazing` and returning `Wow this is really amazing`. String should be capitalized and properly spaced. Using `re` and `string` is not allowed.

Examples:

```python
filter_words('HELLO CAN YOU HEAR ME') #=> Hello can you hear me
filter_words('now THIS is REALLY interesting') #=> Now this is really interesting
filter_words('THAT was EXTRAORDINARY!') #=> That was extraordinary!
```
