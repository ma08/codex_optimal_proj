#Bubbleing around

Since everybody hates chaos and loves sorted lists we should implement some more sorting algorithms. Your task is to implement a Bubble sort (for some help look at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubble_sort) and return a list of snapshots after **each change** of the initial list.

e.g. 

If the initial list would be l=[1,2,4,3] my algorithm rotates l[2] and l[3] and after that it adds [1,2,3,4] to the result, which is a list of snapshots.
```
[1,2,4,3] should return [ [1,2,3,4] ]
[2,1,4,3] should return [ [1,2,4,3], [1,2,3,4] ]
[1,2,3,4] should return []
```
