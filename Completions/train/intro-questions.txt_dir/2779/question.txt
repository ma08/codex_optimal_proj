In his publication Liber Abaci Leonardo Bonacci, aka Fibonacci, posed a problem involving a population of idealized rabbits. These rabbits bred at a fixed rate, matured over the course of one month, had unlimited resources, and were immortal.

Beginning with one immature pair of these idealized rabbits that produce b pairs of offspring at the end of each month. Create a function that determines the number of pair of mature rabbits after n months.

To illustrate the problem, consider the following example:

```python
fib_rabbits(5, 3) returns 19
```

Hint: any Fibonacci number can be computed using the following equation Fn = F(n-1) + F(n-2)
