# Task
 Consider a `bishop`, a `knight` and a `rook` on an `n × m` chessboard. They are said to form a `triangle` if each piece attacks exactly one other piece and is attacked by exactly one piece. 
 
 Calculate the number of ways to choose positions of the pieces to form a triangle.

 Note that the bishop attacks pieces sharing the common diagonal with it; the rook attacks in horizontal and vertical directions; and, finally, the knight attacks squares which are two squares horizontally and one square vertically, or two squares vertically and one square horizontally away from its position.

# Example

 For `n = 2 and m = 3`, the output should be `8`.
