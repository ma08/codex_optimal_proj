Hello everyone.

I have a simple challenge for you today. In mathematics, the formula for finding the sum to infinity of a geometric sequence is: 



**ONLY IF** `-1 < r < 1`

where:

* `a` is the first term of the sequence
* `r` is the common ratio of the sequence (calculated by dividing one term in the sequence by the previous term)

For example: `1 + 0.5 + 0.25 + 0.125 + ... = 2`

Your challenge is to calculate the sum to infinity of the given sequence. The solution must be rounded to 3 decimal places.

If there are no solutions, for example if `r` is out of the above boundaries, return `"No Solutions"`.

Hope you enjoy, let me know of any issues or improvements!
