## Task

Find the sum of the first `n` elements in the Recam√°n Sequence.

Input range:

```python
1000 tests
0 <= n <= 2,500,000
```

## Sequence

The sequence is formed using the next formula:
* We start with `0`
* At each step `i`, we subtract `i` from the previous number
* If the result is not negative, and not yet present in the sequence, it becomes the `i`th element of the sequence
* Otherwise the `i`th element of the sequence will be previous number plus `i`

The beginning of the sequence is `[0, 1, 3, 6, 2, ...]` because:  
0) `0` <- we start with `0`  
1) `1` <- `0 - 1` is negative, hence we choose `0 + 1`  
2) `3` <- `1 - 2` is negative, hence we choose `1 + 2`  
3) `6` <-`3 - 3` is not negative, but we already have a `0` in the sequence, hence we choose `3 + 3`  
4) `2` <- `6 - 4` is positive, and is not present in the sequence yet, so we go for it

```
rec(0) == 0
rec(1) == 0
rec(2) == 1
rec(3) == 4
rec(4) == 10
rec(5) == 12
