In genetics, a sequenceâ€™s motif is a nucleotides (or amino-acid) sequence pattern. Sequence motifs have a biological significance. For more information you can take a look [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequence_motif).


For this kata you need to complete the function `motif_locator`. This function receives 2 arguments - a sequence and a motif. Both arguments are strings.

You should return an array that contains all the start positions of the motif (in order). A sequence may contain 0 or more repetitions of the given motif. Note that the number of the first position is 1, not 0.

**Some examples:**

- For the `sequence` "ACGTGGGGACTAGGGG" and the `motif` "GGGG" the result should be [5, 13]. 
- For the `sequence` "ACCGTACCAAGGGACC" and the `motif` "AAT"  the result should be []
- For the `sequence` "GGG" and the motif "GG" the result should be [1, 2]
