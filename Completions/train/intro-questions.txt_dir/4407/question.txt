Write a function that accepts two parameters (a and b) and says whether a is smaller than, bigger than, or equal to b.

Here is an example code:
var noIfsNoButs = function (a,b) {
  if(a > b) return a + " is greater than " + b
  else if(a < b) return a + " is smaller than " + b
  else if(a == b) return a + " is equal to " + b
}


There's only one problem...

You can't use if statements, and you can't use shorthands like (a < b)?true:false;

in fact the word "if" and the character "?" are not allowed in the code.
