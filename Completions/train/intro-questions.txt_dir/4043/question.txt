# Task

John won the championship of a TV show. He can get some bonuses.

He needs to play a game to determine the amount of his bonus.

Here are `n` rows and `m` columns of cards were placed on the ground. A non-negative number is written on each card.

The rules of the game are:

- Player starts from the top-left coner, walk to the bottom-right coner. 

- Players can only walk downward or right. 

- The sum of the numbers collected by the players will be used as the bonus.

John has two chances to play this game on a game map. Specifically, when John finishes the game, the card on his path will be removed, and then he can walk again.

Your task is to help John calculate the maximum amount of bonuses he can get.

# Input

- `gameMap/gamemap`: A `n` x `m` integer array. Each element represents the number on the card.
  - `4 <= n,m <= 40(Pyhon)/100(JS)`


- All inputs are valid.

# Output

An integer. the maximum amount of bonuses John can get.

# Eaxmple

For 
```
gameMap=
[
[1, 3, 9],
[2, 8, 5],
[5, 7, 4]
]
```
The output should be `39`.

One of the possible solution is:
```
1st game:
[
[>, >, v],
[2, 8, v],
[5, 7, v]
]
1+3+9+5+4=22

2nd game:
[
[v, 0, 0],
[>, v, 0],
[5, >, >]
]
0+2+8+7+0=17

Final bonus = 22 + 17 = 39
