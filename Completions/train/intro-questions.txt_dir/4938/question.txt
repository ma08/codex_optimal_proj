The goal of this kata is to write a function that takes two inputs: a string and a character. The function will count the number of times that character appears in the string. The count is case insensitive.

For example: 

```python
count_char("fizzbuzz","z") => 4
count_char("Fancy fifth fly aloof","f") => 5
```

The character can be any alphanumeric character. 

Good luck.
