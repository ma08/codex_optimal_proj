Create a function that returns an array containing the first `l` digits from the `n`th diagonal of [Pascal's triangle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal's_triangle).

`n = 0` should generate the first diagonal of the triangle (the 'ones'). The first number in each diagonal should be 1.

If `l = 0`, return an empty array. Assume that both `n` and `l` will be non-negative integers in all test cases.
