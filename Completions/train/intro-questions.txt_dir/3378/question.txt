For building the encrypted string:Take every 2nd char from the string, then the other chars, that are not every 2nd char, and concat them as new String.
Do this n times!

Examples:
```
"This is a test!", 1 -> "hsi  etTi sats!"
"This is a test!", 2 -> "hsi  etTi sats!" -> "s eT ashi tist!"
```

Write two methods:
```python
def encrypt(text, n)
def decrypt(encrypted_text, n)
```

```Fsharp
let encrypt (str:string) (n:int) -> string
let decrypt (str:string) (n:int) -> string
```

For both methods:
If the input-string is null or empty return exactly this value!
If n is <= 0 then return the input text.
