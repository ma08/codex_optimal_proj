This challenge extends the previous [repeater()](https://www.codewars.com/kata/thinkful-string-drills-repeater) challenge. Just like last time, your job is to write a function that accepts a string and a number as arguments. This time, however, you should format the string you return like this:
```python
>>> repeater('yo', 3)
'"yo" repeated 3 times is: "yoyoyo"'
>>> repeater('WuB', 6)
'"WuB" repeated 6 times is: "WuBWuBWuBWuBWuBWuB"'
```
