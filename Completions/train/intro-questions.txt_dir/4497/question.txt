Given an array of one's and zero's that represents a positive binary number convert the number to two's complement value.

Two's complement is the way most computers represent positive or negative integers. The most significant bit is negative. 

Examples:

-8 4 2 1 

[1,1,1,1] = -1

[1,0,0,0] = -8

[1,1,0,1] = -3

To get the two's complement negative notation of an integer, you take the number in binary. 

You then invert the digits, and add one to the result. 

For example:

[0,0,1,0] = 2 in base 10

[1,1,0,1] <- Flip the bits

   Add 1
   
[1,1,1,0] = -2

However, the arrays can have varying lengths, not just limited to 4.
