Given two integers `a` and `x`, return the minimum non-negative number to **add to** / **subtract from** `a` to make it a multiple of `x`.

```python
minimum(10, 6)  #= 2

10+2 = 12 which is a multiple of 6
```

## Note
- 0 is always a multiple of `x`

## Constraints

**1 <= a <= 10^(6)**

**1 <= x <= 10^(5)**
