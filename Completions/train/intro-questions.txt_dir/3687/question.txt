# Task
 Your task is to find the smallest number which is evenly divided by all numbers between `m` and `n` (both inclusive).

# Example

 For `m = 1, n = 2`, the output should be `2`.
 
 For `m = 2, n = 3`, the output should be `6`.
 
 For `m = 3, n = 2`, the output should be `6` too.
 
 For `m = 1, n = 10`, the output should be `2520`.

# Input/Output


 - `[input]` integer `m`

  `1 ≤ m ≤ 25`


 - `[input]` integer `n`

  `1 ≤ n ≤ 25`


 - `[output]` an integer
