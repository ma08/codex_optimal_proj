Converting a 24-hour time like "0830" or "2030" to a 12-hour time (like "8:30 am" or "8:30 pm") sounds easy enough, right?  Well, let's see if you can do it!

You will have to define a function named "to12hourtime", and you will be given a four digit time string (in "hhmm" format) as input.

Your task is to return a 12-hour time string in the form of "h:mm am" or "h:mm pm".  (Of course, the "h" part will be two digits if the hour is greater than 9.)
