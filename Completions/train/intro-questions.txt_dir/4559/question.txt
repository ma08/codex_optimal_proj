The [Ones' Complement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ones%27_complement) of a binary number is the number obtained by swapping all the 0s for 1s and all the 1s for 0s. For example:

```
onesComplement(1001) = 0110
onesComplement(1001) = 0110
```

For any given binary number,formatted as a string, return the Ones' Complement of that number.
