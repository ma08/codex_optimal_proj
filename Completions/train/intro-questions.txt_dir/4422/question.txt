We have a string s

We have a number n

Here is a function that takes your string, concatenates the even-indexed chars to the front, odd-indexed chars to the back.

Examples

    s = "Wow Example!"
    result = "WwEapeo xml!"
    s = "I'm JomoPipi"
    result = "ImJm ii' ooPp"
    
The Task:

return the result of the string after applying the function to it n times.

example where s = "qwertyuio" and n = 2:

    after 1 iteration  s = "qetuowryi"
    after 2 iterations s = "qtorieuwy"
    return "qtorieuwy"

 Note 

there's a lot of tests, big strings,
and n is greater than a billion

so be ready to optimize.

after doing this: do it's best friend!
