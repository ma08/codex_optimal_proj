If the first day of the month is a Friday, it is likely that the month will have an `Extended Weekend`. That is, it could have five Fridays, five Saturdays and five Sundays. 

In this Kata, you will be given a start year and an end year. Your task will be to find months that have extended weekends and return:
```
- The first and last month in the range that has an extended weekend
- The number of months that have extended weekends in the range, inclusive of start year and end year.
```

For example:
```python
solve(2016,2020) = ("Jan","May",5). #The months are: Jan 2016, Jul 2016, Dec 2017, Mar 2019, May 2020
```

More examples in test cases. Good luck!
