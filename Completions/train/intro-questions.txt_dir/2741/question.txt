The "Russian Peasant Method" is an old algorithm used by Russian peasants (and before them ancient Egyptians) to perform multiplication.  Consider that X and Y are two numbers.  X can be any number but Y must be a positive integer. To multiply X and Y:

1. Let the product = 0
2. If Y is odd, then the product = product + X
3. X = X + X
4. Y = integer part of Y / 2 
5. if Y is nonzero, repeat from step 2; otherwise the algorithm terminates and returns the product.

For example:

Let X = 10

Let Y = 5

X: 10 20 40 80

Y: 5  2  1  0

product = 10 + 40 = 50

Note: usage of multiplication is of course forbidden...
