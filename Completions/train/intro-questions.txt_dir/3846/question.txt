# Objective

Given the recursive sequence 

fk(n) =


âˆ‘

i
=
0


n



fk(floor(i / k)) where fk(0) = 1

Define a function `f` that takes arguments `k` and `n` and returns the nth term in the sequence fk

## Examples

`f(2, 3)` = f2(3) = 6

`f(2, 200)` = f2(200) = 7389572

`f(7, 500)` = f7(500) = 74845

`f(1000, 0)` = f1000(0) = 1


**Note:** 
No error checking is needed, `k` ranges from 2 to 100 and `n` ranges between 0 and 500000 (mostly small and medium values with a few large ones)


As always any feedback would be much appreciated
