```if:swift
Write a simple `camelCase` function for strings. All words must have their first letter capitalized and all spaces removed.

For instance:

```python
camelcase("hello case") => HelloCase
camelcase("camel case word") => CamelCaseWord
```
```c#
using Kata;

"hello case".CamelCase(); // => "HelloCase"
"camel case word".CamelCase(); // => "CamelCaseWord"
```
