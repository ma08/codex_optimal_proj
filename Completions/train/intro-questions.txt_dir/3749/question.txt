# Write Number in Expanded Form

You will be given a number and you will need to return it as a string in [Expanded Form](https://www.mathplacementreview.com/arithmetic/whole-numbers.php#expanded-form). For example:

```python
expanded_form(12) # Should return '10 + 2'
expanded_form(42) # Should return '40 + 2'
expanded_form(70304) # Should return '70000 + 300 + 4'
```

NOTE: All numbers will be whole numbers greater than 0.
