Give the summation of all even numbers in a Fibonacci sequence up to, but not including, the maximum value.

The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where the next value is the addition of the previous two values. The series starts with 0 and 1:

0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21...

For example:
```python
eve_fib(0)==0
eve_fib(33)==10
eve_fib(25997544)==19544084
```
