The objective of this Kata is to write a function that creates a dictionary of factors for a range of numbers.

The key for each list in the dictionary should be the number. The list associated with each key should possess the factors for the number.

If a number possesses no factors (only 1 and the number itself), the list for the key should be `['None']`

The function possesses two arguments (`n` and `m`). Where `n` is the starting number and `m` is the ending number.

For example: All factors for 2 (`n`) through to 6 (`m`) with the number being the key in the dictionary:

```python
{2: ['None'], 3: ['None'], 4: [2], 5: ['None'], 6: [2, 3]}
```
