A Narcissistic Number is a number of length n in which the sum of its digits to the power of n is equal to the original number. If this seems confusing, refer to the example below.

Ex: 153, where n = 3 (number of digits in 153)
1^(3) + 5^(3) + 3^(3) = 153

Write a method is_narcissistic(i) (in Haskell: isNarcissistic :: Integer -> Bool) which returns whether or not i is a Narcissistic Number.
