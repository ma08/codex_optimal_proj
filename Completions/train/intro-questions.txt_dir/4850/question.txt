Given the moleculer mass of two molecules ( __M1__ and __M2__ ), their masses present ( __m1__ and __m2__ ) in a vessel of volume ( __V__ ) at a specific temperature ( __T__ ). Find the total pressure exerted by the molecules ( __Ptotal__ ) .

input
====

Six values : 

- __m1__
- __m2__
- __M1__
- __M2__
- __V__
- __T__

output
==== 

One value : 

- __Ptotal__ 

notes
====

Units for each of the following are given as under : 

- _m1_ = gram 
- _m2_ = gram
- _M1_ = _gram.mole^(-1)_
- _M2_ = _gram.mole^(-1)_
- _V_             = _dm^(3)_
- _T_             = Celsius
- __Ptotal__ = atmpspheric pressure (_atm_)

Remember : Temperature is given in Celsius while SI unit is Kelvin (_K_)

0 Celsius = 273.15Kelvin

The gas constant (_R_) has value of _0.082dm^(3).atm.K^(-1).mol^(-1)_
