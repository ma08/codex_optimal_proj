We've got a message from the **Librarian**. As usual there're many `o` and `k` in it and, as all codewarriors don't know "Ook" language we need that you translate this message.

**tip** : it seems traditional "Hello World!" would look like :
`Ok, Ook, Ooo?  Okk, Ook, Ok?  Okk, Okk, Oo?  Okk, Okk, Oo?  Okk, Okkkk?  Ok, Ooooo?  Ok, Ok, Okkk?  Okk, Okkkk?  Okkk, Ook, O?  Okk, Okk, Oo?  Okk, Ook, Oo?  Ook, Ooook!`

Your task is to implement a function `okkOokOo(okkOookk)`, that would take the `okkOookk` message as input and return a decoded human-readable string.

*eg*:
```python
okkOokOo('Ok, Ook, Ooo!')  # -> 'H'
okkOokOo('Ok, Ook, Ooo?  Okk, Ook, Ok?  Okk, Okk, Oo?  Okk, Okk, Oo?  Okk, Okkkk!')  # -> 'Hello'
okkOokOo('Ok, Ok, Okkk?  Okk, Okkkk?  Okkk, Ook, O?  Okk, Okk, Oo?  Okk, Ook, Oo?  Ook, Ooook!')  # -> 'World!'
```
