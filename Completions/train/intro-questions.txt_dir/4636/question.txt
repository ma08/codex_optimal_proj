# Hint


This Kata is an extension of the earlier ones in this series. Completing those first will make this task easier.

# Background

My TV remote control has arrow buttons and an `OK` button.

I can use these to move a "cursor" on a logical screen keyboard to type words...

# Keyboard

The screen "keyboard" layouts look like this


  #tvkb {
    width : 400px;
    border: 5px solid gray; border-collapse: collapse;
  }
  #tvkb td {
    color : orange;
    background-color : black;
    text-align : center;
    border: 3px solid gray; border-collapse: collapse;
  }
  #legend {
    width : 400px;
    border: 1px solid gray; border-collapse: collapse;
  }
  #legend td {
    text-align : center;
    border: 1px solid gray; border-collapse: collapse;
  }



Keypad Mode 1 = alpha-numeric (lowercase)
Keypad Mode 3 = symbols




abcde123
fghij456
klmno789
pqrst.@0
uvwxyz_/
aA#SP




^~?!'"()
-:;+&%*=
<>€£$¥¤\
[]{},.@§
#¿¡_/
aA#SP






* `aA#` is the SHIFT key. Pressing this key cycles through THREE keypad modes.
 * **Mode 1** = alpha-numeric keypad with lowercase alpha (as depicted above)
 * **Mode 2** = alpha-numeric keypad with UPPERCASE alpha
 * **Mode 3** = symbolic keypad (as depicted above)
 
 
* `SP` is the space character
* The other (solid fill) keys in the bottom row have no function

## Special Symbols

For your convenience, here are Unicode values for the less obvious symbols of the **Mode 3** keypad


¡ = U-00A1£ = U-00A3¤ = U-00A4¥ = U-00A5
§ = U-00A7¿ = U-00BF€ = U-20AC


# Kata task

How many button presses on my remote are required to type the given `words`?

## Notes

* The cursor always starts on the letter `a` (top left)
* The inital keypad layout is **Mode 1**
* Remember to also press `OK` to "accept" each letter
* Take the shortest route from one letter to the next
* The cursor wraps, so as it moves off one edge it will reappear on the opposite edge
* Although the blank keys have no function, you may navigate through them if you want to
* Spaces may occur anywhere in the `words` string
* Do not press the SHIFT key until you need to. For example, with the word `e.Z`, the SHIFT change happens **after** the `.` is pressed (not before). In other words, do not try to optimize total key presses by pressing SHIFT early.

## C/C++ warriors
The standard I/O libraries choke on wide characters beyond the value 255. This kata includes the Euro € (U-20AC). So the function `ws2utf8()` has been preloaded for converting wchar_t strings to UTF-8 for printing.
```

# Example

words = `Too Easy?`

* T => `a`-`aA#`-OK-`U`-`V`-`W`-`X`-`Y`-`T`-OK = 9
* o => `T`-`Y`-`X`-`W`-`V`-`U`-`aA#`-OK-OK-`a`-`b`-`c`-`d`-`e`-`j`-`o`-OK = 16
* o => `o`-OK = 1
* space => `o`-`n`-`m`-`l`-`q`-`v`-`SP`-OK = 7
* E => `SP`-`aA#`-OK-`A`-`3`-`2`-`1`-`-E`-OK = 8
* a => `E`-`1`-`2`-`3`-`A`-`aA`-OK-OK-`a`-OK = 9
* s => `a`-`b`-`c`-`d`-`i`-`n`-`s`-OK = 7
* y => `s`-`x`-`y`-OK = 3
* ? => `y`-`x`-`w`-`v`-`u`-`aA#`-OK-OK-`^`-`~`-`?`-OK = 11

Answer = 9 + 16 + 1 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 7 + 3 + 11 = 71



*Good Luck!
