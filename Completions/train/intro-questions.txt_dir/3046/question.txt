Given a positive integer `n`, return first n dgits of Thue-Morse sequence, as a string (see examples).

Thue-Morse sequence is a binary sequence with 0 as the first element. The rest of the sequece is obtained by adding the Boolean (binary) complement of a group obtained so far.

```
For example:

0
01
0110
01101001
and so on...
```

Ex.:
```python
thue_morse(1);  #"0"
thue_morse(2);  #"01"
thue_morse(5);  #"01101"
thue_morse(10): #"0110100110"
```

- You don't need to test if n is valid - it will always be a positive integer.
- `n` will be between 1 and 10000
