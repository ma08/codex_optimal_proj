NOTE: It is recommended you complete [Introduction to Esolangs](https://www.codewars.com/kata/esolang-interpreters-number-1-introduction-to-esolangs-and-my-first-interpreter-ministringfuck/) or [MiniBitFlip](https://www.codewars.com/kata/esolang-minibitflip/) before solving this one.
Task:
Make an interpreter for an esoteric language called Ticker. Ticker is a descendant of [Tick](https://www.codewars.com/kata/esolang-tick). Your language has the following commands:

`>`: increment the selector by 1

`<`: decrement the selector by 1

`*`: add the ascii value of selected cell to the output tape

`+`: increment selected cell data by 1. If 256, then it is 0

`-`: increment selected cell data by -1. If less than 0, then 255

`/`: set selected cell data to 0

`!`: add new data cell to the end of the array

You start with selector at `0` and one cell with a value of `0`. If selector goes out of bounds, assume 0 for that cell but do not add it to the memory. If a + or - is being made do not change the value of the assumed cell. It will always stay 0 unless it is added to the memory

In other words:

```
data: start 0 end
selector:   ^
data start 1 2 4 end
selector:        ^
Assume that cell is zero.
```

Examples:
Consider the following program:

```python
'++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++*/+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++*/++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++*/++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++*/+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++*/++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++*/+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++*/+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++*/++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++*/++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++*/++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++*/+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++*/'
```

It's output is this:

```python
'Hello World!'
```

This is made just by using 1 data cell.

Example using multiple data cells:

```python
'++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++*!>+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++*!>++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++*!>++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++*!>+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++*!>++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++*!>+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++*!>+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++*!>++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++*!>++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++*!>++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++*!>+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++*!>'
```

And it's output is still:

```python
'Hello World!'
```

A more efficient example:

```python
'++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++*!>+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++*!>++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++**!>+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++*!>++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++*!>+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++*<<*>>!>++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++*<<<<*!>>>>>++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++*!>+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++*'
```

Which still returns the classic:

```python
'Hello World!'
```
