You are required to create a simple calculator that returns the result of addition, subtraction, multiplication or division of two numbers.

Your function will accept three arguments:
The first and second argument should be numbers.
The third argument should represent a sign indicating the operation to perform on these two numbers.
```if-not:csharp
if the variables are not numbers or the sign does not belong to the list above a message "unknown value" must be returned.
```
```if:csharp
If the sign is not a valid sign, throw an ArgumentException.
```

# Example:

```python
calculator(1, 2, '+') => 3
calculator(1, 2, '$') # result will be "unknown value"
```

Good luck!
