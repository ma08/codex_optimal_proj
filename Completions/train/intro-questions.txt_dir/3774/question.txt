Define a function that takes one integer argument and returns logical value `true` or `false` depending on if the integer is a prime.

Per Wikipedia, a prime number (or a prime) is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.

## Requirements

* You can assume you will be given an integer input.
* You can not assume that the integer will be only positive. You may be given negative numbers as well (or `0`).
* **NOTE on performance**: There are no fancy optimizations required, but still *the* most trivial solutions might time out. Numbers go up to 2^31 (or similar, depends on language version). Looping all the way up to `n`, or `n/2`, will be too slow.

## Example
```nasm    
mov edi, 1
call is_prime    ; EAX <- 0 (false)

mov edi, 2
call is_prime    ; EAX <- 1 (true)

mov edi, -1
call is_prime    ; EAX <- 0 (false)
```
