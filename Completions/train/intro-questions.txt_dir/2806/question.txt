# Task
 Imagine a standard chess board with only two white and two black knights placed in their standard starting positions: the white knights on b1 and g1; the black knights on b8 and g8.

 There are two players: one plays for `white`, the other for `black`. During each move, the player picks one of his knights and moves it to an unoccupied square according to standard chess rules. Thus, a knight on d5 can move to any of the following squares: b6, c7, e7, f6, f4, e3, c3, and b4, as long as it is not occupied by either a friendly or an enemy knight.

 The players take turns in making moves, starting with the white player. Given the configuration `positions` of the knights after an unspecified number of moves, determine whose turn it is.

# Example

 For `positions = "b1;g1;b8;g8"`, the output should be `true`.

 The configuration corresponds to the initial state of the game. Thus, it's white's turn.

# Input/Output


 - `[input]` string `positions`

    The positions of the four knights, starting with white knights, separated by a semicolon, in the chess notation.


 - `[output]` a boolean value

    `true` if white is to move, `false` otherwise.
