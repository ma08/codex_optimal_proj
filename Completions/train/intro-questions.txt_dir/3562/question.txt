In computer science and discrete mathematics, an [inversion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inversion_%28discrete_mathematics%29) is a pair of places in a sequence where the elements in these places are out of their natural order. So, if we use ascending order for a group of numbers, then an inversion is when larger numbers appear before lower number in a sequence.

Check out this example sequence: ```(1, 2, 5, 3, 4, 7, 6)``` and we can see here three inversions
```5``` and ```3```; ```5``` and ```4```; ```7``` and ```6```.

You are given a sequence of numbers and you should count the number of inversions in this sequence.

```Input```: A sequence as a tuple of integers.

```Output```: The inversion number as an integer.

Example:
```python
  count_inversion((1, 2, 5, 3, 4, 7, 6)) == 3
  count_inversion((0, 1, 2, 3)) == 0
```
