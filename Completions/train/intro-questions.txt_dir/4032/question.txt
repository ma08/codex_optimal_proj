Consider the number triangle below, in which each number is equal to the number above plus the number to the left. If there is no number above, assume it's a `0`.

The triangle has `5` rows and the sum of the last row is `sum([1,4,9,14,14]) = 42`.

You will be given an integer `n` and your task will be to return the sum of the last row of a triangle of `n` rows. 

In the example above:
More examples in test cases. Good luck!

### Note

This kata uses native arbitrary precision integer numbers ( `BigInt`, `1n` ).  
Unfortunately, the testing framework and even native `JSON` do not fully support them yet.  
`console.log(1n)` and `(1n).toString()` work and can be used for debugging.  

We apologise for the inconvenience.
