This is a follow up from my kata Insert Dashes. 
Write a function ```insertDashII(num)``` that will insert dashes ('-') between each two odd numbers and asterisk ('\*') between each even numbers in ```num``` 
For example: 
```insertDashII(454793)``` --> 4547-9-3  
```insertDashII(1012356895)``` --> 10123-56*89-5 

Zero shouldn't be considered even or odd.
