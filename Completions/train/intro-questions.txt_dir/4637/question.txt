Mary wrote a recipe book and is about to publish it, but because of a new European law, she needs to update and include all measures in grams.

Given all the measures in tablespoon (`tbsp`) and in teaspoon (`tsp`), considering `1 tbsp = 15g` and `1 tsp = 5g`, append to the end of the measurement the biggest equivalent integer (rounding up).

## Examples

```
"2 tbsp of butter"    -->  "2 tbsp (30g) of butter"

"1/2 tbsp of oregano" -->  "1/2 tbsp (8g) of oregano"

"1/2 tsp of salt"     -->  "1/2 tbsp (3g) of salt"

"Add to the mixing bowl and coat well with 1 tbsp of olive oil & 1/2 tbsp of dried dill" -->
"Add to the mixing bowl and coat well with 1 tbsp (15g) of olive oil & 1/2 tbsp (8g) of dried dill"
```
