___

Upside-Down Pyramid Addition is the process of taking a list of numbers and consecutively adding them together until you reach one number.

When given the numbers `2, 1, 1` the following process occurs:
```
 2   1   1
   3   2 
     5
```

This ends in the number `5`.

___

### YOUR TASK

Given the right side of an Upside-Down Pyramid (Ascending), write a function that will return the original list.

### EXAMPLE

```python
reverse([5, 2, 1]) == [2, 1, 1]
```

NOTE: The Upside-Down Pyramid will never be empty and will always consist of positive integers ONLY.
