# Context

According to Wikipedia : "The seventh son of a seventh son is a concept from folklore regarding special powers given to, or held by, such a son. **The seventh son must come from an unbroken line with no female siblings born between, and be, in turn, born to such a seventh son.**"

# Your task

You will be given a string of JSON, consisting of a family tree containing people's names, genders and children. Your task will be to find the seventh sons of seventh sons in the family tree, and return a __set__ of their names. If there are none, return an __empty set__.


## Tips

* Have a good look at the sample test cases.

* For a seventh son to be a seventh son, there must not be any daughters in the line leading to him. There may be daughters after him, though.

* **You may want to use the json module for this one.**
