Given a lowercase string that has alphabetic characters only and no spaces, return the highest value of consonant substrings. Consonants are any letters of the alphabet except `"aeiou"`. 

We shall assign the following values: `a = 1, b = 2, c = 3, .... z = 26`.

For example, for the word "zodiacs", let's cross out the vowels. We get: "z **~~o~~** d **~~ia~~** cs"

For C: do not mutate input.

More examples in test cases. Good luck!
