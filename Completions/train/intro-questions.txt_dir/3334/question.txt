Write a function which reduces fractions to their simplest form! Fractions will be presented as an array/tuple (depending on the language), and the reduced fraction must be returned as an array/tuple:

```
input:   [numerator, denominator]
output:  [newNumerator, newDenominator]
example: [45, 120] --> [3, 8]
```

All numerators and denominators will be positive integers.
