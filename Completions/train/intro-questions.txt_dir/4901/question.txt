We all use 16:9, 16:10, 4:3 etc. ratios every day. Main task is to determine image ratio by its width and height dimensions. 

Function should take width and height of an image and return a ratio string (ex."16:9").
If any of width or height entry is 0 function should throw an exception (or return `Nothing`).
