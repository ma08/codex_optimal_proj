Your friend has invited you to a party, and tells you to meet them in the line to get in. The one problem is it's a masked party. Everyone in line is wearing a colored mask, including your friend. Find which people in line could be your friend.

Your friend has told you that he will be wearing a `RED` mask, and has **TWO** other friends with him, both wearing `BLUE` masks.

Input to the function will be an array of strings, each representing a colored mask. For example:
```python
line = ['blue','blue','red','red','blue','green']
```

The output of the function should be the number of people who could possibly be your friend.
```python
friend_find(['blue','blue','red','red','blue','green','chipmunk'])  # return 1
```
