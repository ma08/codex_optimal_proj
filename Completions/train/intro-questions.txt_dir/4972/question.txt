Linked Lists - Length & Count

Implement Length() to count the number of nodes in a linked list.
Implement Count() to count the occurrences of an integer in a linked list.


I've decided to bundle these two functions within the same Kata since they are both very similar.

The `push()`/`Push()` and `buildOneTwoThree()`/`BuildOneTwoThree()` functions do not need to be redefined.
