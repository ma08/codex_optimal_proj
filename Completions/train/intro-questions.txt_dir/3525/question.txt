Iahub got bored, so he invented a game to be played on paper.
 He writes n integers a1, a2, ..., an. Each of those integers can be either 0 or 1. He's allowed to do exactly one move: he chooses two indices i and j (1 ≤ i ≤ j ≤ n) and flips all values ak for which their positions are in range [i, j] (that is i ≤ k ≤ j). Flip the value of x means to apply operation x = 1 - x.
 The goal of the game is that after exactly one move to obtain the maximum number of ones. Write a program to solve the little game of Iahub.
```
@param {Array} line of the input there are n integers: a1, a2, ..., an. 1 ≤ n ≤ 100. It is guaranteed that each of those n values is either 0 or 1
@return {Integer} the maximal number of 1s that can be obtained after exactly one move
```
Examples :
```
[1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]  =>  5
[1, 0, 0, 1]  =>  4

```
Note:
 In the first case, flip the segment from 2 to 6 (i = 2, j = 6). That flip changes the sequence, it becomes: [1 1 1 0 1 1]. So, it contains four ones. There is no way to make the whole sequence equal to [1 1 1 1 1 1].
 In the second case, flipping only the second and the third element (i = 2, j = 3) will turn all numbers into 1.
