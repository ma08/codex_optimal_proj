In this Kata, you will be given a string and your task is to determine if that string can be a palindrome if we rotate one or more characters to the left.

```Haskell
solve("4455") = true, because after 1 rotation, we get "5445" which is a palindrome
solve("zazcbaabc") = true, because after 3 rotations, we get "abczazcba", a palindrome
```

More examples in test cases. Input will be strings of lowercase letters or numbers only.

Good luck!
