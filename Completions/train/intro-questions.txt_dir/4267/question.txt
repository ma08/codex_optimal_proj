In Dark Souls, players level up trading souls for stats. 8 stats are upgradable this way: vitality, attunement, endurance, strength, dexterity, resistance, intelligence, and faith. Each level corresponds to adding one point to a stat of the player's choice. Also, there are 10 possible classes each having their own starting level and stats:

```
Warrior     (Level 4):  11, 8, 12, 13, 13, 11, 9, 9
Knight      (Level 5):  14, 10, 10, 11, 11, 10, 9, 11
Wanderer    (Level 3):  10, 11, 10, 10, 14, 12, 11, 8
Thief       (Level 5):  9, 11, 9, 9, 15, 10, 12, 11
Bandit      (Level 4):  12, 8, 14, 14, 9, 11, 8, 10
Hunter      (Level 4):  11, 9, 11, 12, 14, 11, 9, 9
Sorcerer    (Level 3):  8, 15, 8, 9, 11, 8, 15, 8
Pyromancer  (Level 1):  10, 12, 11, 12, 9, 12, 10, 8
Cleric      (Level 2):  11, 11, 9, 12, 8, 11, 8, 14
Deprived    (Level 6):  11, 11, 11, 11, 11, 11, 11, 11
```

From level 1, the necessary souls to level up each time up to 11 are `673`, `690`, `707`, `724`, `741`, `758`, `775`, `793`, `811`, and `829`. Then from 11 to 12 and onwards the amount is defined by the expression `round(pow(x, 3) * 0.02 + pow(x, 2) * 3.06 + 105.6 * x - 895)` where `x` is the number corresponding to the next level.

Your function will receive a string with the character class and a list of stats. It should calculate which level is required to get the desired character build and the amount of souls needed to do so. The result should be a string in the format: `'Starting as a [CLASS], level [N] will require [M] souls.'` where `[CLASS]` is your starting class, `[N]` is the required level, and `[M]` is the amount of souls needed respectively.
