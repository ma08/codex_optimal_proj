A famous casino is suddenly faced with a sharp decline of their revenues. They decide to offer Texas hold'em also online. Can you help them by writing an algorithm that can rank poker hands? 

## Task

Create a poker hand that has a method to compare itself to another poker hand:

```python
compare_with(self, other_hand)
```

A poker hand has a constructor that accepts a string containing 5 cards:
```python
PokerHand("KS 2H 5C JD TD")
```

The characteristics of the string of cards are:
* Each card consists of two characters, where
 * The first character is the value of the card: `2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, T(en), J(ack), Q(ueen), K(ing), A(ce)`
 * The second character represents the suit: `S(pades), H(earts), D(iamonds), C(lubs)`
* A space is used as card separator between cards

The result of your poker hand compare can be one of these 3 options:

```python
[ "Win", "Tie", "Loss" ]
```

## Notes
* Apply the [Texas Hold'em](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_hold_%27em) rules for ranking the cards.
* Low aces are **NOT** valid in this kata.
* There is no ranking for the suits.
