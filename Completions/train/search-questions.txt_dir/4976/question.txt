The function must return the sequence of titles that match the string passed as an argument. 

```if:javascript
TITLES is a preloaded sequence of strings. 
```

```python
titles = ['Rocky 1', 'Rocky 2', 'My Little Poney']
search(titles, 'ock') --> ['Rocky 1', 'Rocky 2']
```

But the function return some weird result and skip some of the matching results.

Does the function have special movie taste? 

Let's figure out !
