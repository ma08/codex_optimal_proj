```

You have the following lattice points with their corresponding coordinates and each one with an specific colour.

 ```
Point   [x ,  y]     Colour
----------------------------
  A     [ 3,  4]     Blue
  B     [-7, -1]     Red
  C     [ 7, -6]     Yellow
  D     [ 2,  5]     Yellow
  E     [ 1, -5]     Red
  F     [-1,  4]     Red
  G     [ 1,  7]     Red
  H     [-3,  5]     Red
  I     [-3, -5]     Blue
  J     [ 4,  1]     Blue
```
We want to count the triangles that have the three vertices with the same colour. The following picture shows the distribution of the points in the plane with the required triangles.

The input that we will have for the field of lattice points described above is:

```
[[[3, -4], "blue"],  [[-7, -1], "red"], [[7, -6], "yellow"], [[2, 5], "yellow"],
 [[1, -5], "red"],   [[-1, 4], "red"],  [[1, 7], "red"],     [[-3, 5], "red"], 
 [[-3, -5], "blue"], [[4, 1], "blue"] ]
```
We see the following result from it:

```
Colour   Amount of Triangles       Triangles
Yellow         0                    -------
Blue           1                      AIJ
Red            10                   BEF,BEG,BEH,BFG,BFH,BGH,EFG,EFH,EHG,FGH
```
As we have 5 different points in red and each combination of 3 points that are not aligned.

We need a code that may give us the following information in order:

```
1) Total given points
2) Total number of colours
3) Total number of possible triangles
4) and 5) The colour (or colours, sorted alphabetically) with the highest amount of triangles
```

In Python our function will work like:

```
[10, 3, 11, ["red",10]]) == count_col_triang([[[3, -4], "blue"],  [[-7, -1], "red"], [[7, -6], "yellow"], [[2, 5], "yellow"], 
                                              [[1, -5], "red"],   [[-1, 4], "red"],  [[1, 7], "red"],     [[-3, 5], "red"],
                                              [[-3, -5], "blue"], [[4, 1], "blue"] ])
```
In the following case we have some points that are aligned and we have less triangles that can be formed:

```
[10, 3, 7, ["red", 6]] == count_col_triang([[[3, -4], "blue"],  [[-7, -1], "red"], [[7, -6], "yellow"], [[2, 5], "yellow"],
                                            [[1, -5], "red"],   [[1, 1], "red"],   [[1, 7], "red"],     [[1, 4], "red"], 
                                            [[-3, -5], "blue"], [[4, 1], "blue"] ])
```
Just to see the change with the previous case we have this:

In the special case that the list of points does not generate an even single triangle, the output will be like this case:

```
[9, 3, 0, []] == count_col_triang([[[1, -2], "red"], [[7, -6], "yellow"], [[2, 5], "yellow"], [[1, -5], "red"],
                                  [[1, 1], "red"],   [[1, 7], "red"],     [[1, 4], "red"],    [[-3, -5], "blue"], 
                                  [[4, 1], "blue"] ])
```
It will be this case:

If in the result we have two or more colours with the same maximum amount of triangles, the last list should be like (e.g)

```
[35, 6, 35, ["blue", "red", "yellow", 23]]     # having the names of the colours sorted alphabetically
```
For the condition of three algined points A, B, C, you should know that the the following determinant should be 0.

```
 | xA    yA    1|
 | xB    yB    1|    = 0
 | xC    yC    1|

```
Assumptions:

- In the list you have unique points, so a point can have only one colour.

- All the inputs are valid

Enjoy it!

___For java users:___

Two immutable objects, `ColouredPoint` and `TriangleResult`, have been designed for you in the preloaded part. You will receive inputs as lists of ColouredPoint objects and will return a TriangleResult object. For the last one, you may note the organization of the arguments of the constructor which differs a bit from the description above.

You may find below the signatures of the available methods of these objects:
