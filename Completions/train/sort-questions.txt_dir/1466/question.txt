An $N$-bonacci sequence is an infinite sequence $F_1, F_2, \ldots$ such that for each integer $i > N$, $F_i$ is calculated as $f(F_{i-1}, F_{i-2}, \ldots, F_{i-N})$, where $f$ is some function. A XOR $N$-bonacci sequence is an $N$-bonacci sequence for which $f(F_{i-1}, F_{i-2}, \ldots, F_{i-N}) = F_{i-1} \oplus F_{i−2} \oplus \ldots \oplus F_{i−N}$, where $\oplus$ denotes the bitwise XOR operation.
Recently, Chef has found an interesting sequence $S_1, S_2, \ldots$, which is obtained from prefix XORs of a XOR $N$-bonacci sequence $F_1, F_2, \ldots$. Formally, for each positive integer $i$, $S_i = F_1 \oplus F_2 \oplus \ldots \oplus F_i$. You are given the first $N$ elements of the sequence $F$, which uniquely determine the entire sequence $S$.
You should answer $Q$ queries. In each query, you are given an index $k$ and you should calculate $S_k$. It is guaranteed that in each query, $S_k$ does not exceed $10^{50}$.

-----Input-----
- The first line of the input contains two space-separated integers $N$ and $Q$.
- The second line contains $N$ space-separated integers $F_1, F_2, \ldots, F_N$.
- The following $Q$ lines describe queries. Each of these lines contains a single integer $k$.

-----Output-----
For each query, print a single line containing one integer $S_k$.

-----Constraints-----
- $1 \le N, Q \le 10^5$
- $0 \le F_i \le 10^9$ for each $i$ such that $1 \le i \le N$
- $1 \le k \le 10^9$
