Not considering number 1, the integer 153 is the first integer having this property:
the sum of the third-power of each of its digits  is equal to 153. Take a look:
153 = 1^3 + 5^3 + 3^3 = 1 + 125 + 27 = 153

The next number that experiments this particular behaviour is 370 with the same power.

Write the function `eq_sum_powdig()`, that finds the numbers below a given upper limit `hMax` that fulfill this property but with different exponents as a power for the digits.

eq_sum_powdig(hMax, exp): ----> sequence of numbers (sorted list) (Number one should not be considered).

Let's see some cases:
```python
eq_sum_powdig(100, 2) ----> []

eq_sum_powdig(1000, 2) ----> []

eq_sum_powdig(200, 3) ----> [153]

eq_sum_powdig(370, 3) ----> [153, 370]
```
Enjoy it !!
