#### Task:

Your job here is to implement a function `factors`, which takes a number `n`, and outputs an array of arrays comprised of two
parts, `sq` and `cb`. The part `sq` will contain all the numbers that, when squared, yield a number which is a factor of `n`,
while the `cb` part will contain all the numbers that, when cubed, yield a number which is a factor of `n`.  Discard all `1`s
from both arrays.

Both `sq` and `cb` should be sorted in ascending order.

#### What it looks like:

```python
factors(int) #=> [
  sq (all the numbers that can be squared to give a factor of n) : list,
  cb (all the numbers that can be cubed   to give a factor of n) : list
]
```
