You are given three integers $n$, $d$ and $k$.

Your task is to construct an undirected tree on $n$ vertices with diameter $d$ and degree of each vertex at most $k$, or say that it is impossible.

An undirected tree is a connected undirected graph with $n - 1$ edges.

Diameter of a tree is the maximum length of a simple path (a path in which each vertex appears at most once) between all pairs of vertices of this tree.

Degree of a vertex is the number of edges incident to this vertex (i.e. for a vertex $u$ it is the number of edges $(u, v)$ that belong to the tree, where $v$ is any other vertex of a tree).


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains three integers $n$, $d$ and $k$ ($1 \le n, d, k \le 4 \cdot 10^5$).


-----Output-----

If there is no tree satisfying the conditions above, print only one word "NO" (without quotes).

Otherwise in the first line print "YES" (without quotes), and then print $n - 1$ lines describing edges of a tree satisfying the conditions above. Vertices of the tree must be numbered from $1$ to $n$. You can print edges and vertices connected by an edge in any order. If there are multiple answers, print any of them.1
