Little girl Tanya climbs the stairs inside a multi-storey building. Every time Tanya climbs a stairway, she starts counting steps from $1$ to the number of steps in this stairway. She speaks every number aloud. For example, if she climbs two stairways, the first of which contains $3$ steps, and the second contains $4$ steps, she will pronounce the numbers $1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 4$.

You are given all the numbers pronounced by Tanya. How many stairways did she climb? Also, output the number of steps in each stairway.

The given sequence will be a valid sequence that Tanya could have pronounced when climbing one or more stairways.


-----Input-----

The first line contains $n$ ($1 \le n \le 1000$) — the total number of numbers pronounced by Tanya.

The second line contains integers $a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$ ($1 \le a_i \le 1000$) — all the numbers Tanya pronounced while climbing the stairs, in order from the first to the last pronounced number. Passing a stairway with $x$ steps, she will pronounce the numbers $1, 2, \dots, x$ in that order.

The given sequence will be a valid sequence that Tanya could have pronounced when climbing one or more stairways.


-----Output-----

In the first line, output $t$ — the number of stairways that Tanya climbed. In the second line, output $t$ numbers — the number of steps in each stairway she climbed. Write the numbers in the correct order of passage of the stairways.
