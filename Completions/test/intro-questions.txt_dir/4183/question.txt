We have N clocks. The hand of the i-th clock (1≤i≤N) rotates through 360° in exactly T_i seconds.

Initially, the hand of every clock stands still, pointing directly upward.

Now, Dolphin starts all the clocks simultaneously.

In how many seconds will the hand of every clock point directly upward again?

-----Constraints-----
 - 1≤N≤100 
 - 1≤T_i≤10^{18} 
 - All input values are integers.  
 - The correct answer is at most 10^{18} seconds.

-----Input-----
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:  
N
T_1
:  
T_N

-----Output-----
Print the number of seconds after which the hand of every clock point directly upward again.

-----Sample Input-----
2
2
3

-----Sample Output-----
6

We have two clocks. The time when the hand of each clock points upward is as follows:
 - Clock 1: 2, 4, 6, ... seconds after the beginning
 - Clock 2: 3, 6, 9, ... seconds after the beginning
Therefore, it takes 6 seconds until the hands of both clocks point directly upward.
