When Mr. X is away from home, he has decided to use his smartwatch to search the best route to go back home, to participate in ABC.
You, the smartwatch, has found N routes to his home.
If Mr. X uses the i-th of these routes, he will get home in time t_i at cost c_i.
Find the smallest cost of a route that takes not longer than time T.

-----Constraints-----
 - All values in input are integers.
 - 1 \leq N \leq 100
 - 1 \leq T \leq 1000
 - 1 \leq c_i \leq 1000
 - 1 \leq t_i \leq 1000
 - The pairs (c_i, t_i) are distinct.

-----Input-----
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N T
c_1 t_1
c_2 t_2
:
c_N t_N

-----Output-----
Print the smallest cost of a route that takes not longer than time T.
If there is no route that takes not longer than time T, print TLE instead.

-----Sample Input-----
3 70
7 60
1 80
4 50

-----Sample Output-----
4

 - The first route gets him home at cost 7.
 - The second route takes longer than time T = 70.
 - The third route gets him home at cost 4.
Thus, the cost 4 of the third route is the minimum.
