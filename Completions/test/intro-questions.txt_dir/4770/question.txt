Dr. Chaz is hosting a programming contest wrap up dinner. Dr. Chaz has severe OCD and is very strict on rules during dinner, specifically, he needs to be sure that everyone take exactly $1$ piece of chicken at his buffet, even if that will result in an enormous amount of leftovers. This is why every year before the dinner, Dr. Chaz would give a powerful speech: “Everyone, one chicken per person!”

However, Dr. Chaz does not always have an idea how many pieces of chicken he needs, he believes if there are $N$ people at the buffet and everyone takes exactly $1$ piece of chicken, providing $M$ pieces of chicken will be perfect, i.e., is enough and will have no leftovers. Help Dr. Chaz find out whether his decision is good or not!
