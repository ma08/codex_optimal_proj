We have a sequence of length N, a = (a_1, a_2, ..., a_N).
Each a_i is a positive integer.
Snuke's objective is to permute the element in a so that the following condition is satisfied:
 - For each 1 ≤ i ≤ N - 1, the product of a_i and a_{i + 1} is a multiple of 4.
Determine whether Snuke can achieve his objective.

-----Constraints-----
 - 2 ≤ N ≤ 10^5
 - a_i is an integer.
 - 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9

-----Input-----
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N
a_1 a_2 ... a_N

-----Output-----
If Snuke can achieve his objective, print Yes; otherwise, print No.

-----Sample Input-----
3
1 10 100

-----Sample Output-----
Yes

One solution is (1, 100, 10).
