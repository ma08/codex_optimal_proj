For a string of letters, define the Simplicity of the string to be the number of distinct letters in the string. For example, the string string has simplicity $6$, and the string letter has simplicity $4$.

You like strings which have simplicity either $1$ or $2$. Your friend has given you a string and you want to turn it into a string that you like. You have a magic eraser which will delete one letter from any string. Compute the minimum number of letters you must erase in order to turn the string into a string with simplicity at most $2$.

-----Input-----
Each input will consist of a single test case. Note that your program may be run multiple times on different inputs. The input will consist of a line with a single string consisting of at least $1$ and at most $100$ lowercase letters ‘a’-‘z’.

-----Output-----
Output a single integer, indicating the minimum number letters you need to erase in order to give the string a simplicity of $1$ or $2$.
