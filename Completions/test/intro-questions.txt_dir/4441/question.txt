In 2020, AtCoder Inc. with an annual sales of more than one billion yen (the currency of Japan) has started a business in programming education.

One day, there was an exam where a one-year-old child must write a program that prints Hello World, and a two-year-old child must write a program that receives integers A, B and prints A+B.

Takahashi, who is taking this exam, suddenly forgets his age.

He decides to write a program that first receives his age N (1 or 2) as input, then prints Hello World if N=1, and additionally receives integers A, B and prints A+B if N=2.

Write this program for him.  

-----Constraints-----
 - N is 1 or 2.
 - A is an integer between 1 and 9 (inclusive).
 - B is an integer between 1 and 9 (inclusive).

-----Input-----
Input is given from Standard Input in one of the following formats:  
1

2
A
B

-----Output-----
If N=1, print Hello World; if N=2, print A+B.  

-----Sample Input-----
1

-----Sample Output-----
Hello World

As N=1, Takahashi is one year old. Thus, we should print Hello World.
