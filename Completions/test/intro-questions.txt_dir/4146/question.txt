A sequence a_1,a_2,... ,a_n is said to be /\/\/\/ when the following conditions are satisfied:
 - For each i = 1,2,..., n-2, a_i = a_{i+2}.
 - Exactly two different numbers appear in the sequence.
You are given a sequence v_1,v_2,...,v_n whose length is even.
We would like to make this sequence /\/\/\/ by replacing some of its elements.
Find the minimum number of elements that needs to be replaced.

-----Constraints-----
 - 2 \leq n \leq 10^5
 - n is even.
 - 1 \leq v_i \leq 10^5
 - v_i is an integer.

-----Input-----
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
n
v_1 v_2 ... v_n

-----Output-----
Print the minimum number of elements that needs to be replaced.

-----Sample Input-----
4
3 1 3 2

-----Sample Output-----
1

The sequence 3,1,3,2 is not /\/\/\/, but we can make it /\/\/\/ by replacing one of its elements: for example, replace the fourth element to make it 3,1,3,1.
