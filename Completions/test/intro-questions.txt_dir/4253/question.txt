It is known that the area of a regular dodecagon inscribed in a circle of radius a is 3a^2.
Given an integer r, find the area of a regular dodecagon inscribed in a circle of radius r.

-----Constraints-----
 - 1 \leq r \leq 100
 - r is an integer.

-----Input-----
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
r

-----Output-----
Print an integer representing the area of the regular dodecagon.

-----Sample Input-----
4

-----Sample Output-----
48

The area of the regular dodecagon is 3 \times 4^2 = 48.
