An integer X is called a Harshad number if X is divisible by f(X), where f(X) is the sum of the digits in X when written in base 10.
Given an integer N, determine whether it is a Harshad number.

-----Constraints-----
 - 1?N?10^8
 - N is an integer.

-----Input-----
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N

-----Output-----
Print Yes if N is a Harshad number; print No otherwise.

-----Sample Input-----
12

-----Sample Output-----
Yes

f(12)=1+2=3. Since 12 is divisible by 3, 12 is a Harshad number.
