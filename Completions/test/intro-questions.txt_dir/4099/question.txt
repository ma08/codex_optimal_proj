Takahashi is taking exams on N subjects. The score on each subject will be an integer between 0 and K (inclusive).
He has already taken exams on N-1 subjects and scored A_i points on the i-th subject.
His goal is to achieve the average score of M points or above on the N subjects.
Print the minimum number of points Takahashi needs on the final subject to achieve his goal.
If the goal is unachievable, print -1 instead.

-----Constraints-----
 - 2 \leq N \leq 100
 - 1 \leq K \leq 100
 - 1 \leq M \leq K
 - 0 \leq A_i \leq K
 - All values in input are integers.

-----Input-----
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
