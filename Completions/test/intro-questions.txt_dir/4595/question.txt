Snuke has decided to construct a string that starts with A and ends with Z, by taking out a substring of a string s (that is, a consecutive part of s).
Find the greatest length of the string Snuke can construct. Here, the test set guarantees that there always exists a substring of s that starts with A and ends with Z.

-----Constraints-----
 - 1 ≦ |s| ≦ 200{,}000
 - s consists of uppercase English letters.
 - There exists a substring of s that starts with A and ends with Z.

-----Input-----
The input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
s

-----Output-----
Print the answer.

-----Sample Input-----
QWERTYASDFZXCV

-----Sample Output-----
5

By taking out the seventh through eleventh characters, it is possible to construct ASDFZ, which starts with A and ends with Z.
