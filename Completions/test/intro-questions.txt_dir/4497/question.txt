Takahashi loves numbers divisible by 2.
You are given a positive integer N. Among the integers between 1 and N (inclusive), find the one that can be divisible by 2 for the most number of times. The solution is always unique.
Here, the number of times an integer can be divisible by 2, is how many times the integer can be divided by 2 without remainder.
For example,
 - 6 can be divided by 2 once: 6 -> 3.
 - 8 can be divided by 2 three times: 8 -> 4 -> 2 -> 1.
 - 3 can be divided by 2 zero times.

-----Constraints-----
