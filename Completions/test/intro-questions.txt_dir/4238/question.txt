An integer N is a multiple of 9 if and only if the sum of the digits in the decimal representation of N is a multiple of 9.
Determine whether N is a multiple of 9.

-----Constraints-----
 - 0 \leq N < 10^{200000}
 - N is an integer.

-----Input-----
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N

-----Output-----
If N is a multiple of 9, print Yes; otherwise, print No.

-----Sample Input-----
123456789

-----Sample Output-----
Yes

The sum of these digits is 1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9=45, which is a multiple of 9, so 123456789 is a multiple of 9.
