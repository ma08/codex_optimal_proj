You are given three integers, A, B and C.

Among them, two are the same, but the remaining one is different from the rest.

For example, when A=5,B=7,C=5, A and C are the same, but B is different.

Find the one that is different from the rest among the given three integers.  

-----Constraints-----
 - -100 \leq A,B,C \leq 100 
 - A, B and C are integers.
 - The input satisfies the condition in the statement.

-----Input-----
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:  
A B C

-----Output-----
Among A, B and C, print the integer that is different from the rest.

-----Sample Input-----
5 7 5

-----Sample Output-----
7

This is the same case as the one in the statement.
