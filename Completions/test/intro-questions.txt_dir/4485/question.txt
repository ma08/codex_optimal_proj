In Takahashi Kingdom, there is an archipelago of N islands, called Takahashi Islands.
For convenience, we will call them Island 1, Island 2, ..., Island N.
There are M kinds of regular boat services between these islands.
Each service connects two islands. The i-th service connects Island a_i and Island b_i.
Cat Snuke is on Island 1 now, and wants to go to Island N.
However, it turned out that there is no boat service from Island 1 to Island N, so he wants to know whether it is possible to go to Island N by using two boat services.
Help him.

-----Constraints-----
