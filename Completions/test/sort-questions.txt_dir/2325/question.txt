You are given two positive integer numbers x and y. An array F is called an y-factorization of x iff the following conditions are met:  There are y elements in F, and all of them are integer numbers;  $\prod_{i = 1}^{y} F_{i} = x$. 

You have to count the number of pairwise distinct arrays that are y-factorizations of x. Two arrays A and B are considered different iff there exists at least one index i (1 ≤ i ≤ y) such that A_{i} ≠ B_{i}. Since the answer can be very large, print it modulo 10^9 + 7.


-----Input-----

The first line contains one integer q (1 ≤ q ≤ 10^5) — the number of testcases to solve.

Then q lines follow, each containing two integers x_{i} and y_{i} (1 ≤ x_{i}, y_{i} ≤ 10^6). Each of these lines represents a testcase.


-----Output-----

Print q integers. i-th integer has to be equal to the number of y_{i}-factorizations of x_{i} modulo 10^9 + 7.


-----Example-----
Input
2
6 3
4 2

Output
36
6



-----Note-----

In the second testcase of the example there are six y-factorizations:  { - 4,  - 1};  { - 2,  - 2};  { - 1,  - 4};  {1, 4};  {2, 2};  {4, 1}.
