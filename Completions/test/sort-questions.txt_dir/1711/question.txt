Your task is to calculate the number of arrays such that:  each array contains $n$ elements;  each element is an integer from $1$ to $m$;  for each array, there is exactly one pair of equal elements;  for each array $a$, there exists an index $i$ such that the array is strictly ascending before the $i$-th element and strictly descending after it (formally, it means that $a_j < a_{j + 1}$, if $j < i$, and $a_j > a_{j + 1}$, if $j \ge i$). 


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers $n$ and $m$ ($2 \le n \le m \le 2 \cdot 10^5$).


-----Output-----

Print one integer â€” the number of arrays that meet all of the aforementioned conditions, taken modulo $998244353$.

-----Note-----

The arrays in the first example are:  $[1, 2, 1]$;  $[1, 3, 1]$;  $[1, 4, 1]$;  $[2, 3, 2]$;  $[2, 4, 2]$;  $[3, 4, 3]$.
