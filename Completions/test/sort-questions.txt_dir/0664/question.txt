One day, Twilight Sparkle is interested in how to sort a sequence of integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} in non-decreasing order. Being a young unicorn, the only operation she can perform is a unit shift. That is, she can move the last element of the sequence to its beginning:a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} → a_{n}, a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} - 1. 

Help Twilight Sparkle to calculate: what is the minimum number of operations that she needs to sort the sequence?


-----Input-----

The first line contains an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5). The second line contains n integer numbers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} (1 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 10^5).


-----Output-----

If it's impossible to sort the sequence output -1. Otherwise output the minimum number of operations Twilight Sparkle needs to sort it.
