You are given a set of n elements indexed from 1 to n. The weight of i-th element is w_{i}. The weight of some subset of a given set is denoted as $W(S) =|S|\cdot \sum_{i \in S} w_{i}$. The weight of some partition R of a given set into k subsets is $W(R) = \sum_{S \in R} W(S)$ (recall that a partition of a given set is a set of its subsets such that every element of the given set belongs to exactly one subset in partition).

Calculate the sum of weights of all partitions of a given set into exactly k non-empty subsets, and print it modulo 10^9 + 7. Two partitions are considered different iff there exist two elements x and y such that they belong to the same set in one of the partitions, and to different sets in another partition.


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers n and k (1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5) — the number of elements and the number of subsets in each partition, respectively.

The second line contains n integers w_{i} (1 ≤ w_{i} ≤ 10^9)— weights of elements of the set.


-----Output-----

Print one integer — the sum of weights of all partitions of a given set into k non-empty subsets, taken modulo 10^9 + 7.
