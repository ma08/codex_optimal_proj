You are given strings s and t, consisting of lowercase English letters.
You will create a string s' by freely rearranging the characters in s.
You will also create a string t' by freely rearranging the characters in t.
Determine whether it is possible to satisfy s' < t' for the lexicographic order.

-----Notes-----
For a string a = a_1 a_2 ... a_N of length N and a string b = b_1 b_2 ... b_M of length M, we say a < b for the lexicographic order if either one of the following two conditions holds true:
 - N < M and a_1 = b_1, a_2 = b_2, ..., a_N = b_N.
 - There exists i (1 \leq i \leq N, M) such that a_1 = b_1, a_2 = b_2, ..., a_{i - 1} = b_{i - 1} and a_i < b_i. Here, letters are compared using alphabetical order.
For example, xy < xya and atcoder < atlas.

-----Constraints-----
 - The lengths of s and t are between 1 and 100 (inclusive).
 - s and t consists of lowercase English letters.

-----Input-----
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
s
t

-----Output-----
If it is possible to satisfy s' < t', print Yes; if it is not, print No.

-----Sample Input-----
yx
axy

-----Sample Output-----
Yes

We can, for example, rearrange yx into xy and axy into yxa. Then, xy < yxa.
