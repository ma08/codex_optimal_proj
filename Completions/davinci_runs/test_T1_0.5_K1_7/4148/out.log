We have a string S consisting of uppercase English letters. Additionally, an integer N will be given.
Shift each character of S by N in alphabetical order (see below), and print the resulting string.
We assume that A follows Z. For example, shifting A by 2 results in C (A \to B \to C), and shifting Y by 3 results in B (Y \to Z \to A \to B).

-----Constraints-----
 - 0 \leq N \leq 26
 - 1 \leq |S| \leq 10^4
 - S consists of uppercase English letters.

-----Input-----
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N
S

-----Output-----
Print the string resulting from shifting each character of S by N in alphabetical order.

-----Sample Input-----
