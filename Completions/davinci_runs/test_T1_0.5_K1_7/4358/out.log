In some other world, today is the day before Christmas Eve.
Mr. Takaha is buying N items at a department store. The regular price of the i-th item (1 \leq i \leq N) is p_i yen (the currency of Japan).
He has a discount coupon, and can buy one item with the highest price for half the regular price. The remaining N-1 items cost their regular prices. What is the total amount he will pay?

-----Constraints-----
 - 2 \leq N \leq 10
 - 100 \leq p_i \leq 10000
 - p_i is an even number.

-----Input-----
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N
p_1
p_2
:
p_N

-----Output-----
Print the total amount Mr. Takaha will pay.

-----Sample Input-----

4980
7980
6980

-----Sample Output-----

The 7980-yen item gets the discount and the total is 4980 + 7980 / 2 + 6980 = 15950 yen.
