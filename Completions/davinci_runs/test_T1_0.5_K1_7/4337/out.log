In Japan, people make offerings called hina arare, colorful crackers, on March 3.
We have a bag that contains N hina arare. (From here, we call them arare.)
It is known that the bag either contains arare in three colors: pink, white and green, or contains arare in four colors: pink, white, green and yellow.
We have taken out the arare in the bag one by one, and the color of the i-th arare was S_i, where colors are represented as follows - pink: P, white: W, green: G, yellow: Y.
If the number of colors of the arare in the bag was three, print Three; if the number of colors was four, print Four.

-----Constraints-----
 - 1 \leq N \leq 100
 - S_i is P, W, G or Y.
 - There always exist i, j and k such that S_i=P, S_j=W and S_k=G.

-----Input-----
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N
S_1 S_2 ... S_N

-----Output-----
If the number of colors of the arare in the bag was three, print Three; if the number of colors was four, print Four.

-----Sample Input-----
6
G W Y P Y W

-----Sample Output-----
Four

The bag contained arare in four colors, so you should print Four.
