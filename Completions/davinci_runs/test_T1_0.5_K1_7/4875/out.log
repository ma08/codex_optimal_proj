Ancay youyay eakspay igpay atinlay? (Can you speak pig latin?) If you can’t, here are the rules:
 - If a word begins with a consonant, take all of the letters before the first vowel and move them to the end of the word, then add ay to the end of the word. Examples: pig $\to $ igpay, there$\to $ erethay.
 - If a word begins with a vowel (a, e, i, o, u, or y), simply add yay to the end of the word. For this problem, y is always a vowel. Examples: and $\to $ andyay, ordinary$\to $ ordinaryyay.

Although there are many variants of Pig Latin (such as Kedelkloppersprook in Germany), for this problem we will always use the rules described above.

A friend of yours was frustrated with everyone writing in Pig Latin and has asked you to write a program to translate to Pig Latin for him. Ouldway youyay ebay osay indkay otay oday ityay? (Would you be so kind to do it?)

-----Input-----
Input consists of $1$ to $4000$ lines, ending at end of file. Each line contains up to $100$ words, each word up to $30$ characters long, using only the characters a–z (lowercase). Every word contains at least one vowel, and adjacent words are separated by a single space. No punctuation or special characters will appear in the input.

-----Output-----
Your program should output the text translated to Pig Latin using the rules described above.

-----Examples-----
Sample Input:
i cant speak pig latin
Sample Output:
iyay antcay eakspay igpay atinlay
