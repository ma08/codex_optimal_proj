You will be given a string S of length 3 representing the weather forecast for three days in the past.
The i-th character (1 \leq i \leq 3) of S represents the forecast for the i-th day. S, C, and R stand for sunny, cloudy, and rainy, respectively.
You will also be given a string T of length 3 representing the actual weather on those three days.
The i-th character (1 \leq i \leq 3) of S represents the actual weather on the i-th day. S, C, and R stand for sunny, cloudy, and rainy, respectively.
Print the number of days for which the forecast was correct.

-----Constraints-----
 - S and T are strings of length 3 each.
 - S and T consist of S, C, and R.

-----Input-----
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
S
T

-----Output-----
Print the number of days for which the forecast was correct.

-----Sample Input-----
CSS
CSR

-----Sample Output-----
2

 - For the first day, it was forecast to be cloudy, and it was indeed cloudy.
 - For the second day, it was forecast to be sunny, and it was indeed sunny.
