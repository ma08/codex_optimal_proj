Arild just turned $1$ year old, and is currently learning how to count. His favorite thing to count is how many mouthfuls he has in a meal: every time he gets a bite, he will count it by saying the number out loud. 

Unfortunately, talking while having a mouthful sometimes causes Arild to mumble incomprehensibly, making it hard to know how far he has counted. Sometimes you even suspect he loses his count! You decide to write a program to determine whether Arild’s counting makes sense or not.

-----Input-----
The first line of input contains an integer $n$ ($1 \le n \le 1000$), the number of bites Arild receives. Then second line contains $n$ space-separated words spoken by Arild, the $i$’th of which is either a non-negative integer $a_ i$ ($0 \le a_ i \le 10000$) or the string “mumble”.

-----Output-----
If Arild’s counting might make sense, print the string “makes sense”. Otherwise, print the string “something is fishy”.

-----Examples-----
Sample Input 1:
5
1 2 3 mumble 5
Sample Output 1:
makes sense

Sample Input 2:
8
1 2 3 mumble mumble 7 mumble 8
Sample Output 2:
something is fishy
