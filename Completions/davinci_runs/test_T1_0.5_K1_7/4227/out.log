You are given an undirected unweighted graph with N vertices and M edges that contains neither self-loops nor double edges.

Here, a self-loop is an edge where a_i = b_i (1≤i≤M), and double edges are two edges where (a_i,b_i)=(a_j,b_j) or (a_i,b_i)=(b_j,a_j) (1≤i<j≤M).

How many different paths start from vertex 1 and visit all the vertices exactly once?

Here, the endpoints of a path are considered visited.  
For example, let us assume that the following undirected graph shown in Figure 1 is given.
Figure 1: an example of an undirected graph
The following path shown in Figure 2 satisfies the condition.
Figure 2: an example of a path that satisfies the condition
However, the following path shown in Figure 3 does not satisfy the condition, because it does not visit all the vertices.
Figure 3: an example of a path that does not satisfy the condition
Neither the following path shown in Figure 4, because it does not start from vertex 1.
