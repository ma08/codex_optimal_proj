Three people, A, B and C, are trying to communicate using transceivers.
They are standing along a number line, and the coordinates of A, B and C are a, b and c (in meters), respectively.
Two people can directly communicate when the distance between them is at most d meters.
Determine if A and C can communicate, either directly or indirectly.
Here, A and C can indirectly communicate when A and B can directly communicate and also B and C can directly communicate.

-----Constraints-----
 - 1 ≤ a,b,c ≤ 100
 - 1 ≤ d ≤ 100
 - All values in input are integers.

-----Input-----
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
a b c d

-----Output-----
If A and C can communicate, print Yes; if they cannot, print No.

-----Sample Input-----
4 7 9 3

-----Sample Output-----
Yes

A and B can directly communicate, and also B and C can directly communicate, so we should print Yes.
