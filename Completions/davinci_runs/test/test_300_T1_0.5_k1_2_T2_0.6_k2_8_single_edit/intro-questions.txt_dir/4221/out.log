In the Kingdom of AtCoder, people use a language called Taknese, which uses lowercase English letters.
In Taknese, the plural form of a noun is spelled based on the following rules:
 - If a noun's singular form does not end with s, append s to the end of the singular form.
 - If a noun's singular form ends with s, append es to the end of the singular form.
You are given the singular form S of a Taknese noun. Output its plural form.

-----Constraints-----
