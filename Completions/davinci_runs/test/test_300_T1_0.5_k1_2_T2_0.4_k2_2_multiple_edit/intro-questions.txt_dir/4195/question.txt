Today, the memorable AtCoder Beginner Contest 100 takes place. On this occasion, Takahashi would like to give an integer to Ringo.

As the name of the contest is AtCoder Beginner Contest 100, Ringo would be happy if he is given a positive integer that can be divided by 100 exactly D times.
Find the N-th smallest integer that would make Ringo happy.

-----Constraints-----
 - D is 0, 1 or 2.
 - N is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive).

-----Input-----
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
D N

-----Output-----
Print the N-th smallest integer that can be divided by 100 exactly D times.

-----Sample Input-----
0 5

-----Sample Output-----
5

The integers that can be divided by 100 exactly 0 times (that is, not divisible by 100) are as follows: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, ...

Thus, the 5-th smallest integer that would make Ringo happy is 5.
