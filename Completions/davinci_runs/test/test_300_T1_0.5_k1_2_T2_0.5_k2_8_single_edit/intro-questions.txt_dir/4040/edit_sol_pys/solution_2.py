# SOLUTION
# The problem is essentially asking if the platform lengths can be arranged in such a way that you can jump from 0 to n + 1.
# This can be done by arranging the platforms in non-decreasing order and then checking if the first platform is at least d units away from 0. (Note that the platforms can be moved to the left or right, but their relative order must be maintained.)

# CAREFUL: You want to know if it is possible to reach n + 1 from 0 if you can move any platform to the left or to the right arbitrary number of times (possibly, zero) as long as they do not intersect each other (but two platforms can touch each other). It also means that you cannot change the relative order of platforms.
