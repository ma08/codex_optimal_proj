The idea is to start from the center and move the figures to the closest squares. If the center is not empty, we can move the figures in the center to the closest squares and then move the figures in the closest squares to the center. We can repeat the process until all the figures are in the center square. Because we move the figures to the closest squares, the number of moves is minimized. The time complexity is O(n^2), which is the size of the board.\n\nt = int(input())\n\nfor _ in range(t):\n    n = int(input())\n    print(n * (n // 2) ** 2)\n", "\nfrom math import sqrt\n\ndef get_input():\n    t = int(input())\n    for i in range(t):\n        n = int(input())\n        yield n\n\ndef solve(n):\n    if n == 1:\n        return 0\n    return int((n - 1) ** 2)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    for n in get_input():\n        print(solve(n))\n", "\n\ndef get_input():\n    n = int(input())\n    return n\n\ndef solve(n):\n    return n\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    print(solve(get_input()))\n", "\n\n# SOLUTION\n# The problem can be solved with a greedy algorithm.\n# The idea is to start from the center and move the figures to the nearest cells.\n# If the center is not empty, we can move the figures in the center to the nearest cells\n# and then move the figures in the nearest cells to the center.\n# We can repeat the process until all the figures are in the center.\n# Because we move the figures to the nearest cells, the number of moves is minimized.\n# The time complexity is O(n^2), which is the size of the board.\n\nt = int(input())\n\nfor _ in range(t):\n    n = int(input())\n    print(n * (n // 2) ** 2)\n", "\ndef get_input():\n    t = int(input())\n    for i in range(t):\n        n = int(input())\n        yield n, i\n\ndef solve(n, i):\n    if n == 1:\n        return 0\n    return (n - 1)**2\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    for n, i in get_input():\n        print(\"Case #{}: {}\".format(i + 1, solve(n, i)))\n"]
