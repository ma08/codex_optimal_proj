We have N voting papers. The i-th vote (1 \leq i \leq N) has the string S_i written on it.
Print all strings that are written on the most number of votes, in lexicographical order.

-----Constraints-----
 - 1 \leq N \leq 2 \times 10^5
 - S_i (1 \leq i \leq N) are strings consisting of lowercase English letters.
 - The length of S_i (1 \leq i \leq N) is between 1 and 10 (inclusive).

-----Input-----
