Each clause consists of 3 distinct space-separated integers in the range [\u2212n, n] \\ {0}. For each clause, the three values correspond to the three literals in the clause. If the literal is negative, that means that the clause is satisfied if the corresponding variable is set to False, and if it is positive the clause is satisfied if the variable is set to True. \n\nA 3-SAT instance with m clauses and n variables is satisfiable if there is a way to assign values to the n variables such that all m clauses are satisfied.\n\nAn example of a 3-SAT instance is shown below (from sample input 1):\n\n(\u00acx\n1\n\u2228x\n2\n\u2228x\n3\n)\u2227(\u00acx\n1\n\u2228\u00acx\n2\n\u2228x\n3\n)\u2227(x\n1\n\u2228\u00acx\n2\n\u2228x\n3\n)\u2227(x\n1\n\u2228\u00acx\n2\n\u2228\u00acx\n3\n)\u2227(x\n1\n\u2228x\n2\n\u2228\u00acx\n3\n)\n\nThe output is \u201csatisfactory\u201d if the 3-SAT instance is satisfiable, and \u201cunsatisfactory\u201d otherwise.\n\nThe judge \u00d8yvind hates 3-SAT instances with less than eight clauses \u2013 as these are always satisfiable they provide no real challenge for the contestants. Therefore, he will deem such problem instances to be unsatisfactory.
