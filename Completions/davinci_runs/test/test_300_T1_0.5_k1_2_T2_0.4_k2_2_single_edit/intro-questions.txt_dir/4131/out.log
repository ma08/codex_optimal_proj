In Republic of Atcoder, there are N prefectures, and a total of M cities that belong to those prefectures.
City i is established in year Y_i and belongs to Prefecture P_i.
You can assume that there are no multiple cities that are established in the same year.
It is decided to allocate a 12-digit ID number to each city.
If City i is the x-th established city among the cities that belong to Prefecture i, the first six digits of the ID number of City i is P_i, and the last six digits of the ID number is x.
Here, if P_i or x (or both) has less than six digits, zeros are added to the left until it has six digits.
Find the ID numbers for all the cities.
Note that there can be a prefecture with no cities.

-----Constraints-----
 - 1 \leq N \leq 10^5
 - 1 \leq M \leq 10^5
 - 1 \leq P_i \leq N
 - 1 \leq Y_i \leq 10^9
 - Y_i are all different.
 - All values in input are integers.

-----Input-----
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N M
P_1 Y_1
:
P_M Y_M

-----Output-----
Print the ID numbers for all the cities, in ascending order of indices (City 1, City 2, ...).

-----Sample Input-----
2 3
1 32
2 63
1 12

-----Sample Output-----
000001000002
000002000001
000001000001

 - As City 1 is the second established city among the cities that belong to Prefecture 1, its ID number is 000001000002.
 - As City 2 is the first established city among the cities that belong to Prefecture 2, its ID number is 000002000001.
 - As City 3 is the first established city among the cities that belong to Prefecture 1, its ID number is 000001000001.
