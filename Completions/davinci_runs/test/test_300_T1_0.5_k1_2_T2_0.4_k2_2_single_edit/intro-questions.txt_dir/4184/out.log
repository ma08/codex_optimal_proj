We have N weights indexed 1 to N. The mass of the weight indexed i is W_i.
We will divide these weights into two groups: the weights with indices not greater than T, and those with indices greater than T, for some integer 1 \leq T < N. Let S_1 be the sum of the masses of the weights in the former group, and S_2 be the sum of the masses of the weights in the latter group.
Consider all possible such divisions and find the minimum possible absolute difference of S_1 and S_2.

-----Constraints-----
 - 2 \leq N \leq 100
 - 1 \leq W_i \leq 100
 - All values in input are integers.

-----Input-----
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N
W_1 W_2 ... W_{N-1} W_N

-----Output-----
Print the minimum possible absolute difference of S_1 and S_2.

-----Sample Input-----
3
1 2 3

-----Sample Output-----
0

If T = 2, S_1 = 1 + 2 = 3 and S_2 = 3, with the absolute difference of 0.
