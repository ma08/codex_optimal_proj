The door of Snuke's laboratory is locked with a security code.
The security code is a 4-digit number. We say the security code is hard to enter when it contains two consecutive digits that are the same.
You are given the current security code S. If S is hard to enter, print Bad; otherwise, print Good.

-----Constraints-----
 - S is a 4-character string consisting of digits.

-----Input-----
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
S

-----Output-----
If S is hard to enter, print Bad; otherwise, print Good.

-----Sample Input-----
3776

-----Sample Output-----
Bad

The second and third digits are the same, so 3776 is hard to enter.
