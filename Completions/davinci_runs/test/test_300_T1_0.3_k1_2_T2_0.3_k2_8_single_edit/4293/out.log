There are three airports A, B and C, and flights between each pair of airports in both directions.
A one-way flight between airports A and B takes P hours, a one-way flight between airports B and C takes Q hours, and a one-way flight between airports C and A takes R hours.
Consider a route where we start at one of the airports, fly to another airport and then fly to the other airport.
What is the minimum possible sum of the flight times?

-----Constraints-----
 - 1 \leq P,Q,R \leq 100
 - All values in input are integers.

-----Input-----
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
P Q R

-----Output-----
Print the minimum possible sum of the flight times.

-----Sample Input-----
1 3 4

-----Sample Output-----
4

 - The sum of the flight times in the route A \rightarrow B \rightarrow C: 1 + 3 = 4 hours
 - The sum of the flight times in the route A \rightarrow C \rightarrow C: 4 + 3 = 7 hours
 - The sum of the flight times in the route B \rightarrow A \rightarrow C: 1 + 4 = 5 hours
 - The sum of the flight times in the route B \rightarrow C \rightarrow A: 3 + 4 = 7 hours
 - The sum of the flight times in the route C \rightarrow A \rightarrow B: 4 + 1 = 5 hours
 - The sum of the flight times in the route C \rightarrow B \rightarrow A: 3 + 1 = 4 hours
The minimum of these is 4 hours.
