N tiles are arranged in a row from left to right. The initial color of each tile is represented by a string S of length N.
The i-th tile from the left is painted black if the i-th character of S is 0, and painted white if that character is 1.
You want to repaint some of the tiles black or white, so that any two adjacent tiles have different colors.
At least how many tiles need to be repainted to satisfy the condition?

-----Constraints-----
 - 1 \leq |S| \leq 10^5
 - S_i is 0 or 1.

-----Input-----
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
S

-----Output-----
Print the minimum number of tiles that need to be repainted to satisfy the condition.

-----Sample Input-----
000

-----Sample Output-----
1

The condition can be satisfied by repainting the middle tile white.
