The Departed is a 2006 film directed by Martin Scorsese, starring Leonardo DiCaprio, Matt Damon, and Jack Nicholson.
The film is a remake of the 2002 Hong Kong film Infernal Affairs.
The film is set in Boston, Massachusetts and follows the lives of two men on opposite sides of the law: Colin Sullivan (Damon), a young state trooper and mole for Irish mobster Frank Costello (Nicholson), and Billy Costigan (DiCaprio), an undercover cop who infiltrates Costello's crew.
The Departed is the first American film to be directed by Scorsese since Gangs of New York, and marks his return to the crime genre, a genre that he had not worked in since 1990's Goodfellas.
The film debuted at the Venice Film Festival on September 6, 2006, and was released in the United States on October 6, 2006.
The film received critical acclaim, and has been nominated for five Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Best Director, Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Film Editing, and Best Actor in a Supporting Role (for Mark Wahlberg).
