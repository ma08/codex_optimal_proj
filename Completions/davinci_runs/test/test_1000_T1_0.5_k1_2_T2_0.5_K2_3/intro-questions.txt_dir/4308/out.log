Takahashi has decided to distribute N AtCoder Crackers to K users of as evenly as possible.
When all the crackers are distributed, find the minimum possible (absolute) difference between the largest number of crackers received by a user and the smallest number received by a user.

-----Constraints-----
 - 1 \leq N,K \leq 100
 - All values in input are integers.

-----Input-----
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N K

-----Output-----
Print the minimum possible (absolute) difference between the largest number of crackers received by a user and the smallest number received by a user.

-----Sample Input-----
7 3

-----Sample Output-----
1

When the users receive two, two and three crackers, respectively, the (absolute) difference between the largest number of crackers received by a user and the smallest number received by a user, is 1.
