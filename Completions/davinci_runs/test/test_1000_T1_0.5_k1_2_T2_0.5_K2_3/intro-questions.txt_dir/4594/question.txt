An X-layered kagami mochi (X ≥ 1) is a pile of X round mochi (rice cake) stacked vertically where each mochi (except the bottom one) has a smaller diameter than that of the mochi directly below it. For example, if you stack three mochi with diameters of 10, 8 and 6 centimeters from bottom to top in this order, you have a 3-layered kagami mochi; if you put just one mochi, you have a 1-layered kagami mochi.
Lunlun the dachshund has N round mochi, and the diameter of the i-th mochi is d_i centimeters. When we make a kagami mochi using some or all of them, at most how many layers can our kagami mochi have?

-----Constraints-----
 - 1 ≤ N ≤ 100
 - 1 ≤ d_i ≤ 100
 - All input values are integers.

-----Input-----
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N
d_1
:
d_N

-----Output-----
Print the maximum number of layers in a kagami mochi that can be made.

-----Sample Input-----
4
10
8
8
6

-----Sample Output-----
3

If we stack the mochi with diameters of 10, 8 and 6 centimeters from bottom to top in this order, we have a 3-layered kagami mochi, which is the maximum number of layers.
