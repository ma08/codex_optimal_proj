You are given two integers K and S.

Three variable X, Y and Z takes integer values satisfying 0≤X,Y,Z≤K.

How many different assignments of values to X, Y and Z are there such that X + Y + Z = S?  

-----Constraints-----
 - 2≤K≤2500 
 - 0≤S≤3K 
 - K and S are integers.  

-----Input-----
The input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
K S

-----Output-----
Print the number of the triples of X, Y and Z that satisfy the condition.

-----Sample Input-----
2 2

-----Sample Output-----
6

There are six triples of X, Y and Z that satisfy the condition:
 - X = 0, Y = 0, Z = 2 
 - X = 0, Y = 2, Z = 0 
 - X = 2, Y = 0, Z = 0 
 - X = 0, Y = 1, Z = 1 
 - X = 1, Y = 0, Z = 1 
 - X = 1, Y = 1, Z = 0
