We will store the sum of the elements of the i-th sequence without the element with index x as a key, and the pair (i, x) as a value.\n\nIf we get the sum t as a key in the hash table, then we found the answer. Otherwise, we have to update the hash table by adding the sum t as a key and the pair (i, x) as a value.\n\nIf we found the answer, we have to print it. Otherwise, we have to print "NO".\n"""\n\nk = int(input())\n\nsum_ = []\n\nfor i in range(k):\n    n = int(input())\n    a = list(map(int, input().split()))\n    s = sum(a)\n    t = s\n    for j in range(n):\n        t -= a[j]\n        if t in sum_:\n            print("YES")\n            print(sum_.index(t) + 1, j + 1)\n            print(i + 1, j + 1)\n            exit()\n        sum_.append(t)\n\nprint("NO")\n']
