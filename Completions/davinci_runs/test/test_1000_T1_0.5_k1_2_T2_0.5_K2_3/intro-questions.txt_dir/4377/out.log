Polycarp has guessed three positive integers $a$, $b$ and $c$. He keeps these numbers in secret, but he writes down four numbers on a board in arbitrary order — their pairwise sums (three numbers) and sum of all three numbers (one number). So, there are four numbers on a board in random order: $a+b$, $a+c$, $b+c$ and $a+b+c$.

You have to guess three numbers $a$, $b$ and $c$ using given numbers. Print three guessed integers in any order.

Pay attention that some given numbers $a$, $b$ and $c$ can be equal (it is also possible that $a=b=c$).


-----Input-----

The only line of the input contains four positive integers $x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4$ ($2 \le x_i \le 10^9$) — numbers written on a board in random order. It is guaranteed that the answer exists for the given number $x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4$.


-----Output-----

Print such positive integers $a$, $b$ and $c$ that four numbers written on a board are values $a+b$, $a+c$, $b+c$ and $a+b+c$ written in some order. Print $a$, $b$ and $c$ in any order. If there are several answers, you can print any. It is guaranteed that the answer exists.
