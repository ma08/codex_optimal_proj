There are N positive integers written on a blackboard: A_1, ..., A_N.
Snuke can perform the following operation when all integers on the blackboard are even:
 - Replace each integer X on the blackboard by X divided by 2.
Find the maximum possible number of operations that Snuke can perform.

-----Constraints-----
 - 1 \leq N \leq 200
 - 1 \leq A_i \leq 10^9

-----Input-----
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N
A_1 A_2 ... A_N

-----Output-----
Print the maximum possible number of operations that Snuke can perform.

-----Sample Input-----
3
8 12 40

-----Sample Output-----
2

Initially, [8, 12, 40] are written on the blackboard.
Since all those integers are even, Snuke can perform the operation.
After the operation is performed once, [4, 6, 20] are written on the blackboard.
Since all those integers are again even, he can perform the operation.
After the operation is performed twice, [2, 3, 10] are written on the blackboard.
Now, there is an odd number 3 on the blackboard, so he cannot perform the operation any more.
Thus, Snuke can perform the operation at most twice.
