Alice and Bob are playing a new game of stones. There are $N$ stones placed on the ground, forming a sequence. The stones are labeled from $1$ to $N$.

Alice and Bob in turns take exactly two consecutive stones on the ground until there are no consecutive stones on the ground. That is, each player can take stone $i$ and stone $i+1$, where $1 \leq i \leq N - 1$. If the number of stone left is odd, Alice wins. Otherwise, Bob wins.

Assume both Alice and Bob play optimally and Alice plays first, do you know who the winner is?

-----Input-----
The input contains an integer $N$ $(1 \leq N \leq 10000000)$, the number of stones.
