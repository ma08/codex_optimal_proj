You are given an integer $n$ from $1$ to $10^{18}$ without leading zeroes.

In one move you can swap any two adjacent digits in the given number in such a way that the resulting number will not contain leading zeroes. In other words, after each move the number you have cannot contain any leading zeroes.

What is the minimum number of moves you have to make to obtain a number that is divisible by $25$? Print -1 if it is impossible to obtain a number that is divisible by $25$.


-----Input-----

The first line contains an integer $n$ ($1 \le n \le 10^{18}$). It is guaranteed that the first (left) digit of the number $n$ is not a zero.


-----Output-----

If it is impossible to obtain a number that is divisible by $25$, print -1. Otherwise print the minimum number of moves required to obtain such number.

Note that you can swap only adjacent digits in the given number.


-----Examples-----
Input
5071

Output
4

Input
705

Output
1

Input
1241367

Output
-1



-----Note-----

In the first example one of the possible sequences of moves is 5071 $\rightarrow$ 5701 $\rightarrow$ 7501 $\rightarrow$ 7510 $\rightarrow$ 7150.
