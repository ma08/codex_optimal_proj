Takahashi has A cookies, and Aoki has B cookies.
Takahashi will do the following action K times:
 - If Takahashi has one or more cookies, eat one of his cookies.
 - Otherwise, if Aoki has one or more cookies, eat one of Aoki's cookies.
 - If they both have no cookies, do nothing.
In the end, how many cookies will Takahashi and Aoki have, respectively?

-----Constraints-----
 - 0 \leq A \leq 10^{12}
 - 0 \leq B \leq 10^{12}
 - 0 \leq K \leq 10^{12}
 - All values in input are integers.

-----Input-----
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
A B K

-----Output-----
Print the numbers of Takahashi's and Aoki's cookies after K actions.

-----Sample Input-----
2 3 3

-----Sample Output-----
0 2

Takahashi will do the following:
 - He has two cookies, so he eats one of them.
 - Now he has one cookie left, and he eats it.
 - Now he has no cookies left, but Aoki has three, so Takahashi eats one of them.
Thus, in the end, Takahashi will have 0 cookies, and Aoki will have 2.
