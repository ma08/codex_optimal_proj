There is a staircase with N steps. Takahashi is now standing at the foot of the stairs, that is, on the 0-th step.
He can climb up one or two steps at a time.
However, the treads of the a_1-th, a_2-th, a_3-th, \ldots, a_M-th steps are broken, so it is dangerous to set foot on those steps.
How many are there to climb up to the top step, that is, the N-th step, without setting foot on the broken steps?
Find the count modulo 1\ 000\ 000\ 007.

-----Constraints-----
 - 1 \leq N \leq 10^5
 - 0 \leq M \leq N-1
 - 1 \leq a_1 < a_2 <  ...  < a_M \leq N-1

-----Input-----
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N M
a_1
a_2
 .

 .
a_M

-----Output-----
Print the number of ways to climb up the stairs under the condition, modulo 1\ 000\ 000\ 007.

-----Sample Input-----
6 1
3

-----Sample Output-----
4

There are four ways to climb up the stairs, as follows:
 - 0 \to 1 \to 2 \to 4 \to 5 \to 6
 - 0 \to 1 \to 2 \to 4 \to 6
 - 0 \to 2 \to 4 \to 5 \to 6
 - 0 \to 2 \to 4 \to 6
