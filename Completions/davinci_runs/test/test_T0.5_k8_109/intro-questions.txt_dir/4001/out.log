Recently you have received two positive integer numbers $x$ and $y$. You forgot them, but you remembered a shuffled list containing all divisors of $x$ (including $1$ and $x$) and all divisors of $y$ (including $1$ and $y$). If $d$ is a divisor of both numbers $x$ and $y$ at the same time, there are two occurrences of $d$ in the list.

For example, if $x=4$ and $y=6$ then the given list can be any permutation of the list $[1, 2, 4, 1, 2, 3, 6]$. Some of the possible lists are: $[1, 1, 2, 4, 6, 3, 2]$, $[4, 6, 1, 1, 2, 3, 2]$ or $[1, 6, 3, 2, 4, 1, 2]$.

Your problem is to restore suitable positive integer numbers $x$ and $y$ that would yield the same list of divisors (possibly in different order).

It is guaranteed that the answer exists, i.e. the given list of divisors corresponds to some positive integers $x$ and $y$.


-----Input-----

The first line contains one integer $n$ ($2 \le n \le 128$) — the number of divisors of $x$ and $y$.

The second line of the input contains $n$ integers $d_1, d_2, \dots, d_n$ ($1 \le d_i \le 10^4$), where $d_i$ is either divisor of $x$ or divisor of $y$. If a number is divisor of both numbers $x$ and $y$ then there are two copies of this number in the list.


-----Output-----

Print two positive integer numbers $x$ and $y$ — such numbers that merged list of their divisors is the permutation of the given list of integers. It is guaranteed that the answer exists.
