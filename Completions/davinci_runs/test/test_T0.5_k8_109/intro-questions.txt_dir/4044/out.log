You are given three integers $a$, $b$ and $x$. Your task is to construct a binary string $s$ of length $n = a + b$ such that there are exactly $a$ zeroes, exactly $b$ ones and exactly $x$ indices $i$ (where $1 \le i < n$) such that $s_i \ne s_{i + 1}$. It is guaranteed that the answer always exists.

For example, for the string "01010" there are four indices $i$ such that $1 \le i < n$ and $s_i \ne s_{i + 1}$ ($i = 1, 2, 3, 4$). For the string "111001" there are two such indices $i$ ($i = 3, 5$).

Recall that binary string is a non-empty sequence of characters where each character is either 0 or 1.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains three integers $a$, $b$ and $x$ ($1 \le a, b \le 100, 1 \le x < a + b)$.


-----Output-----

Print only one string $s$, where $s$ is any binary string satisfying conditions described above. It is guaranteed that the answer always exists.


-----Examples-----
Input
2 2 1

Output
1100

Input
3 3 3

Output
101100

Input
5 3 6

Output
01010100



-----Note-----

All possible answers for the first example:   1100;  0011. 

All possible answers for the second example:   110100;  101100;  110010;  100110;  011001;  001101;  010011;  001011.
