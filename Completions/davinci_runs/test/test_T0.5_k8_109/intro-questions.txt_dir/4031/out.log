You are given $n$ strings. Each string consists of lowercase English letters. Rearrange (reorder) the given strings in such a way that for every string, all strings that are placed before it are its substrings.

String $a$ is a substring of string $b$ if it is possible to choose several consecutive letters in $b$ in such a way that they form $a$. For example, string "for" is contained as a substring in strings "codeforces", "for" and "therefore", but is not contained as a substring in strings "four", "fofo" and "rof".


-----Input-----

The first line contains an integer $n$ ($1 \le n \le 100$) â€” the number of strings.

The next $n$ lines contain the given strings. The number of letters in each string is from $1$ to $100$, inclusive. Each string consists of lowercase English letters.

Some strings might be equal.


-----Output-----

If it is impossible to reorder $n$ given strings in required order, print "NO" (without quotes).

Otherwise print "YES" (without quotes) and $n$ given strings in required order.


-----Examples-----
Input
5
a
aba
abacaba
ba
aba

Output
YES
a
ba
aba
aba
abacaba

Input
5
a
abacaba
ba
aba
abab

Output
NO

Input
3
qwerty
qwerty
qwerty

Output
YES
qwerty
qwerty
qwerty



-----Note-----

In the second example you cannot reorder the strings because the string "abab" is not a substring of the string "abacaba".
