A string S of an odd length is said to be a strong palindrome if and only if all of the following conditions are satisfied:
 - S is a palindrome.
 - Let N be the length of S. The string formed by the 1-st through ((N-1)/2)-th characters of S is a palindrome.
 - The string consisting of the (N+3)/2-st through N-th characters of S is a palindrome.
Determine whether S is a strong palindrome.

-----Constraints-----
 - S consists of lowercase English letters.
 - The length of S is an odd number between 3 and 99 (inclusive).

-----Input-----
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
S

-----Output-----
If S is a strong palindrome, print Yes;
otherwise, print No.

-----Sample Input-----
akasaka

-----Sample Output-----
Yes

 - S is akasaka.
 - The string formed by the 1-st through the 3-rd characters is aka.
 - The string formed by the 5-th through the 7-th characters is aka.
All of these are palindromes, so S is a strong palindrome.
