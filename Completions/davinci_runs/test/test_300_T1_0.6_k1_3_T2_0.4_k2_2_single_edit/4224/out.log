As AtCoder Beginner Contest 100 is taking place, the office of AtCoder, Inc. is decorated with a sequence of length N, a = {a_1, a_2, a_3, ..., a_N}.

Snuke, an employee, would like to play with this sequence.
Specifically, he would like to repeat the following operation as many times as possible:
For every i satisfying 1 \leq i \leq N, perform one of the following: "divide a_i by 2" and "multiply a_i by 3".  
Here, choosing "multiply a_i by 3" for every i is not allowed, and the value of a_i after the operation must be an integer.

At most how many operations can be performed?

-----Constraints-----
 - N is an integer between 1 and 10 \ 000 (inclusive).
 - a_i is an integer between 1 and 1 \ 000 \ 000 \ 000 (inclusive).

-----Input-----
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N
a_1 a_2 a_3 ... a_N

-----Output-----
Print the maximum number of operations that Snuke can perform.

-----Sample Input-----
3
5 2 4

-----Sample Output-----
3

The sequence is initially {5, 2, 4}. Three operations can be performed as follows:
 - First, multiply a_1 by 3, multiply a_2 by 3 and divide a_3 by 2. The sequence is now {15, 6, 2}.
 - Next, multiply a_1 by 3, divide a_2 by 2 and multiply a_3 by 3. The sequence is now {45, 3, 6}.
 - Finally, multiply a_1 by 3, multiply a_2 by 3 and divide a_3 by 2. The sequence is now {135, 9, 3}.
