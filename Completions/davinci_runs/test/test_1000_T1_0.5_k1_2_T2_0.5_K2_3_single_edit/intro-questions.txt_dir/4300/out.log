It's now the season of TAKOYAKI FESTIVAL!
This year, N takoyaki (a ball-shaped food with a piece of octopus inside) will be served. The deliciousness of the i-th takoyaki is d_i.
As is commonly known, when you eat two takoyaki of deliciousness x and y together, you restore x \times y health points.
There are \frac{N \times (N - 1)}{2} ways to choose two from the N takoyaki served in the festival. For each of these choices, find the health points restored from eating the two takoyaki, then compute the sum of these \frac{N \times (N - 1)}{2} values.

-----Constraints-----
 - All values in input are integers.
 - 2 \leq N \leq 50
 - 0 \leq d_i \leq 100

-----Input-----
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N
d_1 d_2 ... d_N

-----Output-----
Print the sum of the health points restored from eating two takoyaki over all possible choices of two takoyaki from the N takoyaki served.

-----Sample Input-----
3
3 1 2

-----Sample Output-----
11

There are three possible choices:
 - Eat the first and second takoyaki. You will restore 3 health points.
 - Eat the second and third takoyaki. You will restore 2 health points.
 - Eat the first and third takoyaki. You will restore 6 health points.
The sum of these values is 11.
