Alice and Bob are playing One Card Poker.

One Card Poker is a two-player game using playing cards.  
Each card in this game shows an integer between 1 and 13, inclusive.

The strength of a card is determined by the number written on it, as follows:  
Weak 2 < 3 < 4 < 5 < 6 < 7 < 8 < 9 < 10 < 11 < 12 < 13 < 1 Strong  
One Card Poker is played as follows:  
 - Each player picks one card from the deck. The chosen card becomes the player's hand.
 - The players reveal their hands to each other. The player with the stronger card wins the game.
If their cards are equally strong, the game is drawn.  
You are watching Alice and Bob playing the game, and can see their hands.

The number written on Alice's card is A, and the number written on Bob's card is B.

Write a program to determine the outcome of the game.  

-----Constraints-----
 - 1≦A≦13 
 - 1≦B≦13 
 - A and B are integers.

-----Input-----
The input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
A B

-----Output-----
Print Alice if Alice will win. Print Bob if Bob will win. Print Draw if the game will be drawn.

-----Sample Input-----
8 6

-----Sample Output-----
Alice

8 is written on Alice's card, and 6 is written on Bob's card.
Alice has the stronger card, and thus the output should be Alice.
