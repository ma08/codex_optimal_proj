Takahashi is a member of a programming competition site, ButCoder.
Each member of ButCoder is assigned two values: Inner Rating and Displayed Rating.
The Displayed Rating of a member is equal to their Inner Rating if the member has participated in 10 or more contests. Otherwise, the Displayed Rating will be their Inner Rating minus 100 \times (10 - K) when the member has participated in K contests.
Takahashi has participated in N contests, and his Displayed Rating is R. Find his Inner Rating.

-----Constraints-----
 - All values in input are integers.
 - 1 \leq N \leq 100
 - 0 \leq R \leq 4111

-----Input-----
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N R

-----Output-----
Print his Inner Rating.

-----Sample Input-----
2 2919

-----Sample Output-----
3719

Takahashi has participated in 2 contests, which is less than 10, so his Displayed Rating is his Inner Rating minus 100 \times (10 - 2) = 800.
Thus, Takahashi's Inner Rating is 2919 + 800 = 3719.
