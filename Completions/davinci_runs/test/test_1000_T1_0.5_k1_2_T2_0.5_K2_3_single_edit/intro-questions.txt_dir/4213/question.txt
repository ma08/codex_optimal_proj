You are given an integer sequence A of length N.
Find the maximum absolute difference of two elements (with different indices) in A.

-----Constraints-----
 - 2 \leq N \leq 100
 - 1 \leq A_i \leq 10^9
 - All values in input are integers.

-----Input-----
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N
A_1 A_2 ... A_N

-----Output-----
Print the maximum absolute difference of two elements (with different indices) in A.

-----Sample Input-----
4
1 4 6 3

-----Sample Output-----
5

The maximum absolute difference of two elements is A_3-A_1=6-1=5.
