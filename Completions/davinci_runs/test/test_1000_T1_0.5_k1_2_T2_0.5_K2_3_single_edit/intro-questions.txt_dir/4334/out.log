We have A balls with the string S written on each of them and B balls with the string T written on each of them.

From these balls, Takahashi chooses one with the string U written on it and throws it away.

Find the number of balls with the string S and balls with the string T that we have now.

-----Constraints-----
 - S, T, and U are strings consisting of lowercase English letters.
 - The lengths of S and T are each between 1 and 10 (inclusive).
 - S \not= T
 - S=U or T=U.
 - 1 \leq A,B \leq 10
 - A and B are integers.

-----Input-----
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
S T
A B
U

-----Output-----
Print the answer, with space in between.

-----Sample Input-----
red blue
3 4
