Evi has N integers a_1,a_2,..,a_N. His objective is to have N equal integers by transforming some of them.
He may transform each integer at most once. Transforming an integer x into another integer y costs him (x-y)^2 dollars. Even if a_i=a_j (i≠j), he has to pay the cost separately for transforming each of them (See Sample 2).
Find the minimum total cost to achieve his objective.

-----Constraints-----
 - 1≦N≦100
 - -100≦a_i≦100

-----Input-----
The input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N
a_1 a_2 ... a_N

-----Output-----
Print the minimum total cost to achieve Evi's objective.

-----Sample Input-----
2
4 8

-----Sample Output-----
8

Transforming the both into 6s will cost (4-6)^2+(8-6)^2=8 dollars, which is the minimum.
