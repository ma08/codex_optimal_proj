We have N points in the two-dimensional plane. The coordinates of the i-th point are (X_i,Y_i).
Among them, we are looking for the points such that the distance from the origin is at most D. How many such points are there?
We remind you that the distance between the origin and the point (p, q) can be represented as \sqrt{p^2+q^2}.

-----Constraints-----
 - 1 \leq N \leq 2\times 10^5
 - 0 \leq D \leq 2\times 10^5
 - |X_i|,|Y_i| \leq 2\times 10^5
 - All values in input are integers.

-----Input-----
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N D
X_1 Y_1
\vdots
X_N Y_N

-----Output-----
Print an integer representing the number of points such that the distance from the origin is at most D.

-----Sample Input-----
4 5
0 5
-2 4
3 4
4 -4

-----Sample Output-----
3

The distance between the origin and each of the given points is as follows:
 - \sqrt{0^2+5^2}=5
 - \sqrt{(-2)^2+4^2}=4.472\ldots
 - \sqrt{3^2+4^2}=5
 - \sqrt{4^2+(-4)^2}=5.656\ldots
Thus, we have three points such that the distance from the origin is at most 5.
