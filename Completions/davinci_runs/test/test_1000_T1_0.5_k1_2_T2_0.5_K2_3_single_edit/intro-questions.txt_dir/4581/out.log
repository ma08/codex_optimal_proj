In "Takahashi-ya", a ramen restaurant, a bowl of ramen costs 700 yen (the currency of Japan), plus 100 yen for each kind of topping (boiled egg, sliced pork, green onions).
A customer ordered a bowl of ramen and told which toppings to put on his ramen to a clerk. The clerk took a memo of the order as a string S. S is three characters long, and if the first character in S is o, it means the ramen should be topped with boiled egg; if that character is x, it means the ramen should not be topped with boiled egg. Similarly, the second and third characters in S mean the presence or absence of sliced pork and green onions on top of the ramen.
Write a program that, when S is given, prints the price of the corresponding bowl of ramen.

-----Constraints-----
 - S is a string of length 3.
 - Each character in S is o or x.

-----Input-----
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
S

-----Output-----
Print the price of the bowl of ramen corresponding to S.

-----Sample Input-----
oxo

-----Sample Output-----
900

The price of a ramen topped with two kinds of toppings, boiled egg and green onions, is 700 + 100 \times 2 = 900 yen.
