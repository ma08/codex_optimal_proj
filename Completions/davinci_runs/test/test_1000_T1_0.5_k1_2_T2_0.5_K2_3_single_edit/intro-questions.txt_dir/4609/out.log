You are playing the following game with Joisino.
 - Initially, you have a blank sheet of paper.
 - Joisino announces a number. If that number is written on the sheet, erase the number from the sheet; if not, write the number on the sheet. This process is repeated N times.
 - Then, you are asked a question: How many numbers are written on the sheet now?
The numbers announced by Joisino are given as A_1, ... ,A_N in the order she announces them. How many numbers will be written on the sheet at the end of the game?

-----Constraints-----
 - 1≤N≤100000
 - 1≤A_i≤1000000000(=10^9)
 - All input values are integers.

-----Input-----
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N
A_1
:
A_N

-----Output-----
Print how many numbers will be written on the sheet at the end of the game.

-----Sample Input-----
3
6
2
6

-----Sample Output-----
1

The game proceeds as follows:
 - 6 is not written on the sheet, so write 6.
 - 2 is not written on the sheet, so write 2.
 - 6 is written on the sheet, so erase 6.
Thus, the sheet contains only 2 in the end. The answer is 1.
