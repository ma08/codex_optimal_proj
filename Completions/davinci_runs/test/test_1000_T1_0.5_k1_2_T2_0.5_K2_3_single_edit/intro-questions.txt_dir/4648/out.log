You are given an integer $n$. In one move, you can either multiply $n$ by two or divide $n$ by $6$ (if it is divisible by $6$ without the remainder).

Your task is to find the minimum number of moves needed to obtain $1$ from $n$ or determine if it's impossible to do that.

You have to answer $t$ independent test cases.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains one integer $t$ ($1 \le t \le 2 \cdot 10^4$) — the number of test cases. Then $t$ test cases follow. 

The only line of the test case contains one integer $n$ ($1 \le n \le 10^9$).


-----Output-----

For each test case, print the answer — the minimum number of moves needed to obtain $1$ from $n$ if it's possible to do that or -1 if it's impossible to obtain $1$ from $n$.


-----Example-----
Input
7
1
2
3
12
12345
15116544
387420489

Output
0
-1
2
-1
-1
12
36



-----Note-----

Consider the sixth test case of the example. The answer can be obtained by the following sequence of moves from the given integer $15116544$:

  Divide by $6$ and get $2519424$;  divide by $6$ and get $419904$;  divide by $6$ and get $69984$;  divide by $6$ and get $11664$;  multiply by $2$ and get $23328$;  divide by $6$ and get $3888$;  divide by $6$ and get $648$;  divide by $6$ and get $108$;  multiply by $2$ and get $216$;  divide by $6$ and get $36$;  divide by $6$ and get $6$;  divide by $6$ and get $1$.
