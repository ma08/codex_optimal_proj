Given are two strings S and T.
Let us change some of the characters in S so that T will be a substring of S.
At least how many characters do we need to change?
Here, a substring is a consecutive subsequence. For example, xxx is a substring of yxxxy, but not a substring of xxyxx.

-----Constraints-----
 - The lengths of S and T are each at least 1 and at most 1000.
 - The length of T is at most that of S.
 - S and T consist of lowercase English letters.

-----Input-----
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
S
T

-----Output-----
Print the minimum number of characters in S that need to be changed.

-----Sample Input-----
cabacc
abc

-----Sample Output-----
1

For example, changing the fourth character a in S to c will match the second through fourth characters in S to T.
Since S itself does not have T as its substring, this number of changes - one - is the minimum needed.
