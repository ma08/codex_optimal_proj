"""
Takahashi has decided to hold fastest-finger-fast quiz games. Kizahashi, who is in charge of making the scoreboard, is struggling to write the program that manages the players' scores in a game, which proceeds as follows.
A game is played by N players, numbered 1 to N. At the beginning of a game, each player has K points.
When a player correctly answers a question, each of the other N-1 players receives minus one (-1) point. There is no other factor that affects the players' scores.
At the end of a game, the players with 0 points or lower are eliminated, and the remaining players survive.
In the last game, the players gave a total of Q correct answers, the i-th of which was given by Player A_i.
For Kizahashi, write a program that determines whether each of the N players survived this game.

-----Constraints-----
 - All values in input are integers.
 - 2 \leq N \leq 10^5
 - 1 \leq K \leq 10^9
 - 1 \leq Q \leq 10^5
 - 1 \leq A_i \leq N\ (1 \leq i \leq Q)

-----Input-----
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N K Q
A_1
A_2
.
.
.
A_Q

-----Output-----
Print N lines. The i-th line should contain Yes if Player i survived the game, and No otherwise.

-----Sample Input-----
6 3 4
3
1
3
2

-----Sample Output-----
No
No
Yes
No
No
No

In the beginning, the players' scores are (3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3).
 - Player 3 correctly answers a question. The players' scores are now (2, 2, 3, 2, 2, 2).
 - Player 1 correctly answers a question. The players' scores are now (2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1).
 - Player 3 correctly answers a question. The players' scores are now (1, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0).
 - Player 2 correctly answers a question. The players' scores are now (0, 0, 1, -1, -1, -1).
Players 1, 2, 4, 5 and 6, who have 0 points or lower, are eliminated, and Player 3 survives this game.
