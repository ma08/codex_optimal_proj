Takahashi has come to an integer shop to buy an integer.
The shop sells the integers from 1 through 10^9. The integer N is sold for A \times N + B \times d(N) yen (the currency of Japan), where d(N) is the number of digits in the decimal notation of N.
Find the largest integer that Takahashi can buy when he has X yen. If no integer can be bought, print 0.

-----Constraints-----
 - All values in input are integers.
 - 1 \leq A \leq 10^9
 - 1 \leq B \leq 10^9
 - 1 \leq X \leq 10^{18}

-----Input-----
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
A B X

-----Output-----
Print the greatest integer that Takahashi can buy. If no integer can be bought, print 0.

-----Sample Input-----
10 7 100

-----Sample Output-----
9

The integer 9 is sold for 10 \times 9 + 7 \times 1 = 97 yen, and this is the greatest integer that can be bought.
Some of the other integers are sold for the following prices:
 - 10: 10 \times 10 + 7 \times 2 = 114 yen
 - 100: 10 \times 100 + 7 \times 3 = 1021 yen
 - 12345: 10 \times 12345 + 7 \times 5 = 123485 yen
