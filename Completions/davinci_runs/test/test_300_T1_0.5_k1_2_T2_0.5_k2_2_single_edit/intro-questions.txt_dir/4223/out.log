There are N slimes lining up from left to right. The colors of these slimes will be given as a string S of length N consisting of lowercase English letters. The i-th slime from the left has the color that corresponds to the i-th character of S.
Adjacent slimes with the same color will fuse into one larger slime without changing the color. If there were a slime adjacent to this group of slimes before fusion, that slime is now adjacent to the new larger slime.
Ultimately, how many slimes will be there?

-----Constraints-----
 - 1 \leq N \leq 10^5
 - |S| = N
 - S consists of lowercase English letters.

-----Input-----
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N
S

-----Output-----
Print the final number of slimes.

-----Sample Input-----
10
aabbbbaaca

-----Sample Output-----
5

Ultimately, these slimes will fuse into abaca.
