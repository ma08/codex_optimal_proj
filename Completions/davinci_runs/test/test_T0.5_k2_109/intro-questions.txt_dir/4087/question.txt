Polycarp knows that if the sum of the digits of a number is divisible by $3$, then the number itself is divisible by $3$. He assumes that the numbers, the sum of the digits of which is divisible by $4$, are also somewhat interesting. Thus, he considers a positive integer $n$ interesting if its sum of digits is divisible by $4$.

Help Polycarp find the nearest larger or equal interesting number for the given number $a$. That is, find the interesting number $n$ such that $n \ge a$ and $n$ is minimal.


-----Input-----

The only line in the input contains an integer $a$ ($1 \le a \le 1000$).


-----Output-----

Print the nearest greater or equal interesting number for the given number $a$. In other words, print the interesting number $n$ such that $n \ge a$ and $n$ is minimal.
