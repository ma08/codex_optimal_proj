["\n\n# SOLUTION\n# The solution is to use the accumulator when it is possible and use the battery when the accumulator is empty. The accumulator is used when the current segment is exposed to sunlight and the accumulator is not empty. The battery is used when the accumulator is empty and the battery is not empty. The accumulator is recharged when the current segment is exposed to sunlight and the accumulator is empty.
