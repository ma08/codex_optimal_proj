Mr. Infinity has a string S consisting of digits from 1 to 9. Each time the date changes, this string changes as follows:
 - Each occurrence of 2 in S is replaced with 22. Similarly, each 3 becomes 333, 4 becomes 4444, 5 becomes 55555, 6 becomes 666666, 7 becomes 7777777, 8 becomes 88888888 and 9 becomes 999999999. 1 remains as 1.
For example, if S is 1324, it becomes 1333224444 the next day, and it becomes 133333333322224444444444444444 the day after next.
You are interested in what the string looks like after 5 \times 10^{15} days. What is the K-th character from the left in the string after 5 \times 10^{15} days?

-----Constraints-----
 - S is a string of length between 1 and 100 (inclusive).
 - K is an integer between 1 and 10^{18} (inclusive).
 - The length of the string after 5 \times 10^{15} days is at least K.

-----Input-----
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
S
K

-----Output-----
Print the K-th character from the left in Mr. Infinity's string after 5 \times 10^{15} days.

-----Sample Input-----
1214
4

-----Sample Output-----
2

The string S changes as follows:  
 - Now: 1214
 - After one day: 12214444
 - After two days: 1222214444444444444444
 - After three days: 12222222214444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444
The first five characters in the string after 5 \times 10^{15} days is 12222. As K=4, we should print the fourth character, 2.
