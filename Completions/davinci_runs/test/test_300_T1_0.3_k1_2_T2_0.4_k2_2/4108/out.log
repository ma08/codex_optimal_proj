You are given strings S and T consisting of lowercase English letters.
You can perform the following operation on S any number of times:
Operation: Choose two distinct lowercase English letters c_1 and c_2, then replace every occurrence of c_1 with c_2, and every occurrence of c_2 with c_1.
Determine if S and T can be made equal by performing the operation zero or more times.

-----Constraints-----
 - 1 \leq |S| \leq 2 \times 10^5
 - |S| = |T|
 - S and T consists of lowercase English letters.

-----Input-----
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
S
T

-----Output-----
If S and T can be made equal, print Yes; otherwise, print No.

-----Sample Input-----
azzel
apple

-----Sample Output-----
Yes

azzel can be changed to apple, as follows:
 - Choose e as c_1 and l as c_2. azzel becomes azzle.
