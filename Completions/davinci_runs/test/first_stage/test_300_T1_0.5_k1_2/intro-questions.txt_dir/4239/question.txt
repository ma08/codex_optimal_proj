To make it difficult to withdraw money, a certain bank allows its customers to withdraw only one of the following amounts in one operation:
 - 1 yen (the currency of Japan)
 - 6 yen, 6^2(=36) yen, 6^3(=216) yen, ...
 - 9 yen, 9^2(=81) yen, 9^3(=729) yen, ...
At least how many operations are required to withdraw exactly N yen in total?
It is not allowed to re-deposit the money you withdrew.

-----Constraints-----
 - 1 \leq N \leq 100000
 - N is an integer.

-----Input-----
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N

-----Output-----

By withdrawing 1 yen, 9 yen, 36(=6^2) yen and 81(=9^2) yen, we can withdraw 127 yen in four operations.
