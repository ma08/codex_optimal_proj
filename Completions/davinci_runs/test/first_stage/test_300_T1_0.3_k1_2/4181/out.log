There are N+1 towns. The i-th town is being attacked by A_i monsters.
We have N heroes. The i-th hero can defeat monsters attacking the i-th or (i+1)-th town, for a total of at most B_i monsters.
What is the maximum total number of monsters the heroes can cooperate to defeat?

-----Constraints-----
 - All values in input are integers.
 - 1 \leq N \leq 10^5
 - 1 \leq A_i \leq 10^9
 - 1 \leq B_i \leq 10^9

-----Input-----
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N
A_1 A_2 ... A_{N+1}
B_1 B_2 ... B_N

-----Output-----
Print the maximum total number of monsters the heroes can defeat.
