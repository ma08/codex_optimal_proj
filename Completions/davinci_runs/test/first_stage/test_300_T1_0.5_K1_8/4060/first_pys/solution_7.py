"""
Let's fix the number of opening brackets. It's equal to the number of closing brackets.

Now let's see the number of positions $i$ such that if you change the type of the $i$-th bracket, then the resulting bracket sequence becomes regular.

It's clear that if the number of opening brackets is greater than the number of closing brackets, then the answer is $0$.

Now let's consider the case when the number of opening brackets is equal to the number of closing brackets.

Let's count the number of opening brackets before the $i$-th bracket. We'll denote it by $a_i$.

If $a_i > n/2$, then the answer is $0$.

If $a_i \le n/2$, then the answer is $1$.

So the answer is equal to the number of positions $i$ such that $a_i \le n/2$.
