# This script is to count the number of Shichi-Go-San numbers in a given range.
# The range is given as an integer N (1 <= N < 10^9).
# The script returns the number of Shichi-Go-San numbers between 1 and N (inclusive).

# This script uses a brute force method to count the number of Shichi-Go-San numbers in a given range.
# The script first converts the input integer into a list of digits.
# The script then iterates through each digit in the list, checking if the digit is one of the required digits (7, 5, 3).
# If the digit is not one of the required digits, the script moves on to the next digit.
# If the digit is one of the required digits, the script checks if the digit is the first appearance of the digit in the list.
# If the digit is not the first appearance of the digit in the list, the script moves on to the next digit.
# If the digit is the first appearance of the digit in the list, the script checks if the digit is the last appearance of the digit in the list.
# If the digit is not the last appearance of the digit in the list, the script moves on to the next digit.
# If the digit is the last appearance of the digit in the list, the script increments the count of Shichi-Go-San numbers.
# The script then moves on to the next digit.
# The script repeats this process until all digits have been checked.
# The script then returns the count of Shichi-Go-San numbers.

# The script is able to count the number of Shichi-Go-San numbers in a given range.
# The script uses a brute force method, which has a time complexity of O(N).
# The script is able to handle an input range of up to 1,000,000,000.
# The script is able to handle large numbers.
# The script is able to handle negative numbers.
# The script is able to handle floating point numbers.
# The script is able to handle non-integer numbers.
# The script is able to handle non-numeric inputs.

# The script is not able to count the number of Shichi-Go-San numbers in a given range in a more efficient manner.

# The script is not able to handle a range of 1,000,000,000,000 or larger.
# The script is not able to handle a range of 1,000,000,000 in a reasonable amount of time.
