One very experienced problem writer decided to prepare a problem for April Fools Day contest. The task was very simple - given an arithmetic expression, return the result of evaluating this expression. However, looks like there is a bug in the reference solution...


-----Input-----

The only line of input data contains the arithmetic expression. The expression will contain between 2 and 10 operands, separated with arithmetic signs plus and/or minus. Each operand will be an integer between 0 and 255, inclusive.


-----Output-----

Reproduce the output of the reference solution, including the bug.


-----Examples-----
