Takahashi likes the sound when he buys a drink from a vending machine.
That sound can be heard by spending A yen (the currency of Japan) each time.
Takahashi has B yen. He will hear the sound as many times as he can with that money, but at most C times, as he would be satisfied at that time.
How many times will he hear the sound?

-----Constraints-----
 - All values in input are integers.
 - 1 \leq A, B, C \leq 100

-----Input-----
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
A B C

-----Output-----
Print the number of times Takahashi will hear his favorite sound.

-----Sample Input-----
2 11 4

-----Sample Output-----
4

Since he has not less than 8 yen, he will hear the sound four times and be satisfied.
