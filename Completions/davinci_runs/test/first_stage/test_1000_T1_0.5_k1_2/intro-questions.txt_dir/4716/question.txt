Snuke has N sticks.
The length of the i-th stick is l_i.
Snuke is making a snake toy by joining K of the sticks together.
The length of the toy is represented by the sum of the individual sticks that compose it.
Find the maximum possible length of the toy.

-----Constraints-----
 - 1 \leq K \leq N \leq 50
 - 1 \leq l_i \leq 50
 - l_i is an integer.

-----Input-----
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N K
l_1 l_2 l_3 ... l_{N}

-----Output-----
Print the answer.

-----Sample Input-----
5 3
1 2 3 4 5

-----Sample Output-----
12

You can make a toy of length 12 by joining the sticks of lengths 3, 4 and 5, which is the maximum possible length.
