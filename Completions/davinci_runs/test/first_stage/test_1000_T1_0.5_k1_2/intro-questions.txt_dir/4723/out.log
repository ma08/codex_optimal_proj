E869120 found a chest which is likely to contain treasure.

However, the chest is locked. In order to open it, he needs to enter a string S consisting of lowercase English letters.

He also found a string S', which turns out to be the string S with some of its letters (possibly all or none) replaced with ?.  
One more thing he found is a sheet of paper with the following facts written on it:  
 - Condition 1: The string S contains a string T as a contiguous substring.
 - Condition 2: S is the lexicographically smallest string among the ones that satisfy Condition 1.
Print the string S.

If such a string does not exist, print UNRESTORABLE.  

-----Constraints-----
 - 1 \leq |S'|, |T| \leq 50
 - S' consists of lowercase English letters and ?.
 - T consists of lowercase English letters.

-----Input-----
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
S
T'

-----Output-----
Print the string S.

If such a string does not exist, print UNRESTORABLE instead.  

-----Sample Input-----
?tc????
coder

-----Sample Output-----
atcoder

There are 26 strings that satisfy Condition 1: atcoder, btcoder, ctcoder,..., ztcoder.
Among them, the lexicographically smallest is atcoder, so we can say S = atcoder.
