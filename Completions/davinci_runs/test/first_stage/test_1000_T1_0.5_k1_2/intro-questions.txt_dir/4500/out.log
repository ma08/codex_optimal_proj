An elementary school student Takahashi has come to a variety store.
He has two coins, A-yen and B-yen coins (yen is the currency of Japan), and wants to buy a toy that costs C yen. Can he buy it?
Note that he lives in Takahashi Kingdom, and may have coins that do not exist in Japan.

-----Constraints-----
 - All input values are integers.
 - 1 \leq A, B \leq 500
 - 1 \leq C \leq 1000

-----Input-----
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
A B C

-----Output-----
If Takahashi can buy the toy, print Yes; if he cannot, print No.

-----Sample Input-----
