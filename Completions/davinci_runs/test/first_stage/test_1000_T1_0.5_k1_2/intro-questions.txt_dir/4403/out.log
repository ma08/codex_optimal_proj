There is always an integer in Takahashi's mind.
Initially, the integer in Takahashi's mind is 0. Takahashi is now going to eat four symbols, each of which is + or -. When he eats +, the integer in his mind increases by 1; when he eats -, the integer in his mind decreases by 1.
The symbols Takahashi is going to eat are given to you as a string S. The i-th character in S is the i-th symbol for him to eat.
Find the integer in Takahashi's mind after he eats all the symbols.

-----Constraints-----
 - The length of S is 4.
 - Each character in S is + or -.

-----Input-----
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
S

-----Output-----
Print the integer in Takahashi's mind after he eats all the symbols.

-----Sample Input-----
+-++

-----Sample Output-----
2

 - Initially, the integer in Takahashi's mind is 0.
 - The first integer for him to eat is +. After eating it, the integer in his mind becomes 1.
 - The second integer to eat is -. After eating it, the integer in his mind becomes 0.
 - The third integer to eat is +. After eating it, the integer in his mind becomes 1.
 - The fourth integer to eat is +. After eating it, the integer in his mind becomes 2.
Thus, the integer in Takahashi's mind after he eats all the symbols is 2.
