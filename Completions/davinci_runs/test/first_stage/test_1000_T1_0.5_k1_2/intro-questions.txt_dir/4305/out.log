Serval is fighting with a monster.
The health of the monster is H.
In one attack, Serval can decrease the monster's health by A.
There is no other way to decrease the monster's health.
Serval wins when the monster's health becomes 0 or below.
Find the number of attacks Serval needs to make before winning.

-----Constraints-----
 - 1 \leq H \leq 10^4
 - 1 \leq A \leq 10^4
 - All values in input are integers.

-----Input-----
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
H A

-----Output-----
Print the number of attacks Serval needs to make before winning.
