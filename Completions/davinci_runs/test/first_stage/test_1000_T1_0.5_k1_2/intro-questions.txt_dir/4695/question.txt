Based on some criterion, Snuke divided the integers from 1 through 12 into three groups as shown in the figure below.
Given two integers x and y (1 ≤ x < y ≤ 12), determine whether they belong to the same group.

-----Constraints-----
 - x and y are integers.
 - 1 ≤ x < y ≤ 12

-----Input-----
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
x y

-----Output-----
If x and y belong to the same group, print Yes; otherwise, print No.

-----Sample Input-----
1 3

-----Sample Output-----
Yes
