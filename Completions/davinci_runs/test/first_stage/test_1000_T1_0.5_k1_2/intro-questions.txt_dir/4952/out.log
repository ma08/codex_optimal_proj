The recent schoolboard elections were hotly contested: a proposal to swap school start times for elementary and high school students, a controversial new dress code proposal that bans athletic clothes in school, and a proposal to raise real-estate taxes to pay for a new football practice facility, and the list goes on and on. It is now hours after the polls have closed and a winner has yet to emerge! 

In their desperation, the election officials turn to you and ask you to write a program to count the vote!

-----Input-----
The input consists of a single test case, which is a list of votes cast. Each line in the input contains the name of a candidate for whom a vote was cast. A name may consist of multiple words, separated by spaces. Words contain letters or hyphens, but no other punctuation characters. There will be at least $2$ votes on the list. The list of votes ends with a single line containing the characters ***. This line should not be counted. There can be up to $100000$ valid votes.

-----Output-----
If a candidate obtained a simple or absolute majority of all votes cast (that is, more than any other candidate), output the name of this candidate! If no candidate obtained a simple majority, output: “Runoff!” (don’t forget to include the exclamation mark!)

-----Examples-----
Sample Input:
Penny Franklin
Marti Graham
Connie Froggatt
Joseph Ivers
Connie Froggatt
Penny Franklin
Connie Froggatt
Bruce Stanger
Connie Froggatt
Barbara Skinner

Sample Output:
