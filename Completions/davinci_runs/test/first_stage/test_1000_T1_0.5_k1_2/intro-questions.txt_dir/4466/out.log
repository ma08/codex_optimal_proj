There are many people who wants to sit here. A person sitting on the seat will always occupy an interval of length Y centimeters.
We would like to seat as many people as possible, but they are all very shy, and there must be a gap of length at least Z centimeters between two people, and between the end of the seat and a person.
At most how many people can sit on the seat?
