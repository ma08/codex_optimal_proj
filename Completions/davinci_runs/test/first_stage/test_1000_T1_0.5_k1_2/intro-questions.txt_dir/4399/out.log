In AtCoder City, there are three stations numbered 1, 2, and 3.
Each of these stations is operated by one of the two railway companies, A and B. A string S of length 3 represents which company operates each station. If S_i is A, Company A operates Station i; if S_i is B, Company B operates Station i.
To improve the transportation condition, for each pair of a station operated by Company A and one operated by Company B, there will be a bus service connecting them.
Determine if there is a pair of stations that will be connected by a bus service.

-----Constraints-----
