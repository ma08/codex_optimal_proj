A company has N members, who are assigned ID numbers 1, ..., N.
Every member, except the member numbered 1, has exactly one immediate boss with a smaller ID number.
When a person X is the immediate boss of a person Y, the person Y is said to be an immediate subordinate of the person X.
You are given the information that the immediate boss of the member numbered i is the member numbered A_i. For each member, find how many immediate subordinates it has.

-----Constraints-----
 - 2 \leq N \leq 2 \times 10^5
 - 1 \leq A_i < i

-----Input-----
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N
A_2 ... A_N

-----Output-----
For each of the members numbered 1, 2, ..., N, print the number of immediate subordinates it has, in its own line.

-----Sample Input-----
5
1 1 2 2

-----Sample Output-----
2
2
0
0
0

The member numbered 1 has two immediate subordinates: the members numbered 2 and 3.
