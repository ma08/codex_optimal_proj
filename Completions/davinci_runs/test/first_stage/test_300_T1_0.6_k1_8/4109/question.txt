Takahashi, who is a novice in competitive programming, wants to learn M algorithms.
Initially, his understanding level of each of the M algorithms is 0.
Takahashi is visiting a bookstore, where he finds N books on algorithms.
The i-th book (1\leq i\leq N) is sold for C_i yen (the currency of Japan). If he buys and reads it, his understanding level of the j-th algorithm will increase by A_{i,j} for each j (1\leq j\leq M).
There is no other way to increase the understanding levels of the algorithms.
Takahashi's objective is to make his understanding levels of all the M algorithms X or higher. Determine whether this objective is achievable. If it is achievable, find the minimum amount of money needed to achieve it.
