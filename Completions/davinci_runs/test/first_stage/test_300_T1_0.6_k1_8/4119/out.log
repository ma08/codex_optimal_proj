We will play a one-player game using a number line and N pieces.
First, we place each of these pieces at some integer coordinate.
Here, multiple pieces can be placed at the same coordinate.
Our objective is to visit all of the M coordinates X_1, X_2, ..., X_M with these pieces, by repeating the following move:
Move: Choose a piece and let x be its coordinate. Put that piece at coordinate x+1 or x-1.
Note that the coordinates where we initially place the pieces are already regarded as visited.
Find the minimum number of moves required to achieve the objective.

-----Constraints-----
 - All values in input are integers.
 - 1 \leq N \leq 10^5
 - 1 \leq M \leq 10^5
 - -10^5 \leq X_i \leq 10^5
 - X_1, X_2, ..., X_M are all different.

-----Input-----
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N M
X_1 X_2 ... X_M

-----Output-----
Find the minimum number of moves required to achieve the objective.

-----Sample Input-----
2 5
10 12 1 2 14

-----Sample Output-----
5

The objective can be achieved in five moves as follows, and this is the minimum number of moves required.
 - Initially, put the two pieces at coordinates 1 and 10.
 - Move the piece at coordinate 1 to 2.
 - Move the piece at coordinate 10 to 11.
 - Move the piece at coordinate 11 to 12.
 - Move the piece at coordinate 12 to 13.
 - Move the piece at coordinate 13 to 14.
