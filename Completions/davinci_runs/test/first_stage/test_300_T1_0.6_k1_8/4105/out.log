The king of Berland organizes a ball! $n$ pair are invited to the ball, they are numbered from $1$ to $n$. Each pair consists of one man and one woman. Each dancer (either man or woman) has a monochrome costume. The color of each costume is represented by an integer from $1$ to $k$, inclusive.

Let $b_i$ be the color of the man's costume and $g_i$ be the color of the woman's costume in the $i$-th pair. You have to choose a color for each dancer's costume (i.e. values $b_1, b_2, \dots, b_n$ and $g_1, g_2, \dots g_n$) in such a way that:  for every $i$: $b_i$ and $g_i$ are integers between $1$ and $k$, inclusive;  there are no two completely identical pairs, i.e. no two indices $i, j$ ($i \ne j$) such that $b_i = b_j$ and $g_i = g_j$ at the same time;  there is no pair such that the color of the man's costume is the same as the color of the woman's costume in this pair, i.e. $b_i \ne g_i$ for every $i$;  for each two consecutive (adjacent) pairs both man's costume colors and woman's costume colors differ, i.e. for every $i$ from $1$ to $n-1$ the conditions $b_i \ne b_{i + 1}$ and $g_i \ne g_{i + 1}$ hold. 

Let's take a look at the examples of bad and good color choosing (for $n=4$ and $k=3$, man is the first in a pair and woman is the second):

Bad color choosing:   $(1, 2)$, $(2, 3)$, $(3, 2)$, $(1, 2)$ — contradiction with the second rule (there are equal pairs);  $(2, 3)$, $(1, 1)$, $(3, 2)$, $(1, 3)$ — contradiction with the third rule (there is a pair with costumes of the same color);  $(1, 2)$, $(2, 3)$, $(1, 3)$, $(2, 1)$ — contradiction with the fourth rule (there are two consecutive pairs such that colors of costumes of men/women are the same). 

Good color choosing:   $(1, 2)$, $(2, 1)$, $(1, 3)$, $(3, 1)$;  $(1, 2)$, $(3, 1)$, $(2, 3)$, $(3, 2)$;  $(3, 1)$, $(1, 2)$, $(2, 3)$, $(3, 2)$. 

You have to find any suitable color choosing or say that no suitable choosing exists.


-----Input-----

The only line of the input contains two integers $n$ and $k$ ($2 \le n, k \le 2 \cdot 10^5$) — the number of pairs and the number of colors.


-----Output-----

If it is impossible to find any suitable colors choosing, print "NO".

Otherwise print "YES" and then the colors of the costumes of pairs in the next $n$ lines. The $i$-th line should contain two integers $b_i$ and $g_i$ — colors of costumes of man and woman in the $i$-th pair, respectively.

You can print each letter in any case (upper or lower). For example, "YeS", "no" and "yES" are all acceptable.
