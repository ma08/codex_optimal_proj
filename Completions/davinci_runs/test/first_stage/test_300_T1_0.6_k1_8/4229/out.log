Let us define the FizzBuzz sequence a_1,a_2,... as follows:
 - If both 3 and 5 divides i, a_i=\mbox{FizzBuzz}.
 - If the above does not hold but 3 divides i, a_i=\mbox{Fizz}.
 - If none of the above holds but 5 divides i, a_i=\mbox{Buzz}.
 - If none of the above holds, a_i=i.
Find the sum of all numbers among the first N terms of the FizzBuzz sequence.

-----Constraints-----
 - 1 \leq N \leq 10^6

-----Input-----
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N

-----Output-----
Print the sum of all numbers among the first N terms of the FizzBuzz sequence.

-----Sample Input-----
15

-----Sample Output-----
60

The first 15 terms of the FizzBuzz sequence are:
1,2,\mbox{Fizz},4,\mbox{Buzz},\mbox{Fizz},7,8,\mbox{Fizz},\mbox{Buzz},11,\mbox{Fizz},13,14,\mbox{FizzBuzz}
Among them, numbers are 1,2,4,7,8,11,13,14, and the sum of them is 60.
