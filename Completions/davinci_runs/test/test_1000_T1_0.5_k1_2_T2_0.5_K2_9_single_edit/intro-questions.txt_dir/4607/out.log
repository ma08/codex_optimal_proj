In AtCoder Kingdom, Gregorian calendar is used, and dates are written in the "year-month-day" order, or the "month-day" order without the year.

For example, May 3, 2018 is written as 2018-5-3, or 5-3 without the year.  
In this country, a date is called Takahashi when the month and the day are equal as numbers. For example, 5-5 is Takahashi.

How many days from 2018-1-1 through 2018-a-b are Takahashi?

-----Constraints-----
 - a is an integer between 1 and 12 (inclusive).
 - b is an integer between 1 and 31 (inclusive).
 - 2018-a-b is a valid date in Gregorian calendar.

-----Input-----
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
a b

-----Output-----
Print the number of days from 2018-1-1 through 2018-a-b that are Takahashi.

-----Sample Input-----
