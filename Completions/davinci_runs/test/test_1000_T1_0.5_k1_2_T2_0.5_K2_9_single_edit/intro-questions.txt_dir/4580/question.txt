In AtCoder, a person who has participated in a contest receives a color, which corresponds to the person's rating as follows:  
 - Rating 1-399 : gray
 - Rating 400-799 : brown
 - Rating 800-1199 : green
 - Rating 1200-1599 : cyan
 - Rating 1600-1999 : blue
 - Rating 2000-2399 : yellow
 - Rating 2400-2799 : orange
 - Rating 2800-3199 : red
Other than the above, a person whose rating is 3200 or higher can freely pick his/her color, which can be one of the eight colors above or not.

Currently, there are N users who have participated in a contest in AtCoder, and the i-th user has a rating of a_i.

Find the minimum and maximum possible numbers of different colors of the users.  

-----Constraints-----
 - 1 ≤ N ≤ 100
 - 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 4800
 - a_i is an integer.

-----Input-----
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N
a_1 a_2 ... a_N

-----Output-----
Print the minimum possible number of different colors of the users, and the maximum possible number of different colors, with a space in between.  

-----Sample Input-----
4
2100 2500 2700 2700

-----Sample Output-----
