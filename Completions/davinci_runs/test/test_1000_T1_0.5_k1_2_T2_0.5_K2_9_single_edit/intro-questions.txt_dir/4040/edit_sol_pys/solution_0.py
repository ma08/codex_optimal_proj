# SOLUTION
# The problem is essentially asking if the platform lengths can be arranged in such a way that you can jump from 0 to n+1.
# This can be done by arranging the platforms in non-decreasing order and then checking if the first platform is at least d units away from 0.

# CAREFUL: The platforms can be moved to the left or right, but their relative order must be maintained.
# So, if the platform lengths are [1, 2, 1], then the platform lengths can be arranged as [2, 1, 1] or [1, 2, 1] or [1, 1, 2].
# But, the platform lengths cannot be arranged as [1, 1, 2] or [1, 2, 1] or [2, 1, 1].

# CAREFUL: The platforms can touch each other, but they cannot intersect.
