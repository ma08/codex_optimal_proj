You planned a trip using trains and buses.
The train fare will be A yen (the currency of Japan) if you buy ordinary tickets along the way, and B yen if you buy an unlimited ticket.
Similarly, the bus fare will be C yen if you buy ordinary tickets along the way, and D yen if you buy an unlimited ticket.
Find the minimum total fare when the optimal choices are made for trains and buses.

-----Constraints-----
 - 1 \leq A \leq 1 000
 - 1 \leq B \leq 1 000
 - 1 \leq C \leq 1 000
 - 1 \leq D \leq 1 000
 - All input values are integers.

-----Input-----
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
A
B
C
D

-----Output-----
Print the minimum total fare.

-----Sample Input-----
600
300
220
420

-----Sample Output-----
520

The train fare will be 600 yen if you buy ordinary tickets, and 300 yen if you buy an unlimited ticket.
Thus, the optimal choice for trains is to buy an unlimited ticket for 300 yen.
On the other hand, the optimal choice for buses is to buy ordinary tickets for 220 yen.
Therefore, the minimum total fare is 300 + 220 = 520 yen.
