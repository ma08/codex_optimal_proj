You are given two positive integers $n$ and $k$. Print the $k$-th positive integer that is not divisible by $n$.

For example, if $n=3$, and $k=7$, then all numbers that are not divisible by $3$ are: $1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 10, 11, 13 \dots$. The $7$-th number among them is $10$.


-----Input-----

The first line contains an integer $t$ ($1 \le t \le 1000$) — the number of test cases in the input. Next, $t$ test cases are given, one per line.

Each test case is two positive integers $n$ ($2 \le n \le 10^9$) and $k$ ($1 \le k \le 10^9$).


-----Output-----

For each test case print the $k$-th positive integer that is not divisible by $n$.
