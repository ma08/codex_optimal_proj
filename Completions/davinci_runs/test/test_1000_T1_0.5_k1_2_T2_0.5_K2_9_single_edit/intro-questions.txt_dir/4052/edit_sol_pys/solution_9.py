<!-- One of the most common uses of JavaScript is to redirect the user to or automatically open another web page location.

There are a couple different ways to write this JavaScript code, which are:

window.location.href="https://www.google.com";
window.location.assign("https://www.google.com");
window.location.replace("https://www.google.com");
window.location.href = window.location.href;
window.location.reload(true);
The first two methods are the same, and the third method will replace the current page in the history list with the one you're redirecting to.

The fourth method will refresh the current page, which is the same as pressing the refresh button on your browser.

The fifth method will refresh the page from the server instead of the browser's cache.

The following code is an example of how you would use JavaScript to automatically open a new window with a specific web page location:

window.open("https://www.google.com");
