Polycarp loves ciphers. He has invented his own cipher called repeating.

Repeating cipher is used for strings. To encrypt the string $s=s_{1}s_{2} \dots s_{m}$ ($1 \le m \le 10$), Polycarp uses the following algorithm:

  he writes down $s_1$ ones,  he writes down $s_2$ twice,  he writes down $s_3$ three times,  ...  he writes down $s_m$ $m$ times. 

For example, if $s$="bab" the process is: "b" $\to$ "baa" $\to$ "baabbb". So the encrypted $s$="bab" is "baabbb".

Given string $t$ — the result of encryption of some string $s$. Your task is to decrypt it, i. e. find the string $s$.


-----Input-----

The first line contains integer $n$ ($1 \le n \le 55$) — the length of the encrypted string. The second line of the input contains $t$ — the result of encryption of some string $s$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters. The length of $t$ is exactly $n$.

It is guaranteed that the answer to the test exists.


-----Output-----

Print such string $s$ that after encryption it equals $t$.
