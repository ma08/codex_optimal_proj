Takahashi has a deposit of 100 yen (the currency of Japan) in AtCoder Bank.
The bank pays an annual interest rate of 1 % compounded annually. (A fraction of less than one yen is discarded.)
Assuming that nothing other than the interest affects Takahashi's balance, in how many years does the balance reach X yen or above for the first time?

-----Constraints-----
 -  101 \le X \le 10^{18} 
 - All values in input are integers.

-----Input-----
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
X

-----Output-----
Print the number of years it takes for Takahashi's balance to reach X yen or above for the first time.

-----Sample Input-----
103

-----Sample Output-----
3

 - The balance after one year is 101 yen.
 - The balance after two years is 102 yen.
 - The balance after three years is 103 yen.
Thus, it takes three years for the balance to reach 103 yen or above.
