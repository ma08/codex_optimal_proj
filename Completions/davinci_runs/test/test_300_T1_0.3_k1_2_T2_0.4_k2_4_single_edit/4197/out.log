Takahashi is a teacher responsible for a class of N students.
The students are given distinct student numbers from 1 to N.
Today, all the students entered the classroom at different times.
According to Takahashi's record, there were A_i students in the classroom when student number i entered the classroom (including student number i).
From these records, reconstruct the order in which the students entered the classroom.

-----Constraints-----
 -  1 \le N \le 10^5 
 -  1 \le A_i \le N 
 -  A_i \neq A_j  (i \neq j)
 - All values in input are integers.

-----Input-----
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N
A_1 A_2 \ldots A_N

-----Output-----
Print the student numbers of the students in the order the students entered the classroom.

-----Sample Input-----
3
2 3 1

-----Sample Output-----
3 1 2

First, student number 3 entered the classroom.
Then, student number 1 entered the classroom.
Finally, student number 2 entered the classroom.
