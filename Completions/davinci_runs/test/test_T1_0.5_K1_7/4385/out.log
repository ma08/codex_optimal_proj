In AtCoder city, there are five antennas standing in a straight line. They are called Antenna A, B, C, D and E from west to east, and their coordinates are a, b, c, d and e, respectively.

Two antennas can communicate directly if the distance between them is k or less, and they cannot if the distance is greater than k.

Determine if there exists a pair of antennas that cannot communicate directly.

Here, assume that the distance between two antennas at coordinates p and q (p < q) is q - p.  

-----Constraints-----
 - a, b, c, d, e and k are integers between 0 and 123 (inclusive).
 - a < b < c < d < e

-----Input-----
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
a
b
c
d
e
k

-----Output-----
Print :( if there exists a pair of antennas that cannot communicate directly, and print Yay! if there is no such pair.

-----Sample Input-----
1
2
4
8
9
15

-----Sample Output-----
Yay!

In this case, there is no pair of antennas that cannot communicate directly, because:
 - the distance between A and B is 2 - 1 = 1
 - the distance between A and C is 4 - 1 = 3
 - the distance between A and D is 8 - 1 = 7
 - the distance between A and E is 9 - 1 = 8
 - the distance between B and C is 4 - 2 = 2
 - the distance between B and D is 8 - 2 = 6
 - the distance between B and E is 9 - 2 = 7
 - the distance between C and D is 8 - 4 = 4
 - the distance between C and E is 9 - 4 = 5
 - the distance between D and E is 9 - 8 = 1
and none of them is greater than 15. Thus, the correct output is Yay!.
