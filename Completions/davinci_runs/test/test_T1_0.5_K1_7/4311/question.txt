A sequence a=\{a_1,a_2,a_3,......\} is determined as follows:
 - The first term s is given as input.
 - Let f(n) be the following function: f(n) = n/2 if n is even, and f(n) = 3n+1 if n is odd.
 - a_i = s when i = 1, and a_i = f(a_{i-1}) when i > 1.
Find the minimum integer m that satisfies the following condition:
 - There exists an integer n such that a_m = a_n (m > n).

-----Constraints-----
 - 1 \leq s \leq 100
 - All values in input are integers.
 - It is guaranteed that all elements in a and the minimum m that satisfies the condition are at most 1000000.

-----Input-----
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
s

-----Output-----
Print the minimum integer m that satisfies the condition.

-----Sample Input-----
8

-----Sample Output-----
5

a=\{8,4,2,1,4,2,1,4,2,1,......\}. As a_5=a_2, the answer is 5.
