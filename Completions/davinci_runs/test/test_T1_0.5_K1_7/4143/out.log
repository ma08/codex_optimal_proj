In 2028 and after a continuous growth, AtCoder Inc. finally built an empire with six cities (City 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6)!
There are five means of transport in this empire:
 - Train: travels from City 1 to 2 in one minute. A train can occupy at most A people.
 - Bus: travels from City 2 to 3 in one minute. A bus can occupy at most B people.
 - Taxi: travels from City 3 to 4 in one minute. A taxi can occupy at most C people.
 - Airplane: travels from City 4 to 5 in one minute. An airplane can occupy at most D people.
 - Ship: travels from City 5 to 6 in one minute. A ship can occupy at most E people.
For each of them, one vehicle leaves the city at each integer time (time 0, 1, 2, ...).
There is a group of N people at City 1, and they all want to go to City 6.

At least how long does it take for all of them to reach there? 
You can ignore the time needed to transfer.  

-----Constraints-----
 - 1 \leq N, A, B, C, D, E \leq 10^{15}
 - All values in input are integers.

-----Input-----
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N
A
B
C
D
E

-----Output-----
Print the minimum time required for all of the people to reach City 6, in minutes.

-----Sample Input-----
5
3
2
4
3
5

-----Sample Output-----
7

One possible way to travel is as follows.
First, there are N = 5 people at City 1, as shown in the following image:

In the first minute, three people travels from City 1 to City 2 by train. Note that a train can only occupy at most three people.

In the second minute, the remaining two people travels from City 1 to City 2 by train, and two of the three people who were already at City 2 travels to City 3 by bus. Note that a bus can only occupy at most two people.

In the third minute, two people travels from City 2 to City 3 by train, and another two people travels from City 3 to City 4 by taxi.

From then on, if they continue traveling without stopping until they reach City 6, all of them can reach there in seven minutes.

There is no way for them to reach City 6 in 6 minutes or less.
