We have sticks numbered 1, \cdots, N. The length of Stick i (1 \leq i \leq N) is L_i.
In how many ways can we choose three of the sticks with different lengths that can form a triangle?
That is, find the number of triples of integers (i, j, k) (1 \leq i < j < k \leq N) that satisfy both of the following conditions:
 - L_i, L_j, and L_k are all different.
 - There exists a triangle whose sides have lengths L_i, L_j, and L_k.

-----Constraints-----
 - 1 \leq N \leq 100
 - 1 \leq L_i \leq 10^9
 - All values in input are integers.

-----Input-----
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N
L_1 L_2 \cdots L_N

-----Output-----
Print the number of ways to choose three of the sticks with different lengths that can form a triangle.

-----Sample Input-----
5
4 4 9 7 5

-----Sample Output-----
5

The following five triples (i, j, k) satisfy the conditions: (1, 3, 4), (1, 4, 5), (2, 3, 4), (2, 4, 5), and (3, 4, 5).
