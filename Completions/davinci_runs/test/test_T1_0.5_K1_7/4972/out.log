You are playing the following simple game with a friend:
 - The first player picks a positive integer $X$.
 - The second player gives a list of $k$ positive integers $Y_1, \ldots , Y_ k$ such that $(Y_1+1)(Y_2+1) \cdots (Y_ k+1) = X$, and gets $k$ points.

Write a program that plays the second player.

-----Input-----
The input consists of a single integer $X$ satisfying $10^3 \le X \le 10^9$, giving the number picked by the first player.

-----Output-----
Write a single integer $k$, giving the number of points obtained by the second player, assuming she plays as good as possible.

-----Examples-----
