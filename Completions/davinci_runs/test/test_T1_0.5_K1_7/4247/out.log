We have a permutation p = {p_1,\ p_2,\ ...,\ p_n} of {1,\ 2,\ ...,\ n}.
Print the number of elements p_i (1 < i < n) that satisfy the following condition:
 - p_i is the second smallest number among the three numbers p_{i - 1}, p_i, and p_{i + 1}.

-----Constraints-----
 - All values in input are integers.
 - 3 \leq n \leq 20
 - p is a permutation of {1,\ 2,\ ...,\ n}.

-----Input-----
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
n
p_1 p_2 ... p_n

-----Output-----
Print the number of elements p_i (1 < i < n) that satisfy the condition.

-----Sample Input-----
5
1 3 5 4 2

-----Sample Output-----
2

p_2 = 3 is the second smallest number among p_1 = 1, p_2 = 3, and p_3 = 5. Also, p_4 = 4 is the second smallest number among p_3 = 5, p_4 = 4, and p_5 = 2. These two elements satisfy the condition.
