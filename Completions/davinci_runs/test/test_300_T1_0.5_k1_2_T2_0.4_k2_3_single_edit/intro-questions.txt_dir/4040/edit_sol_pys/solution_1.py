# SOLUTION
# The problem is essentially asking if the platform lengths can be arranged in such a way that you can jump from 0 to n+1.
# This can be done by arranging the platforms in non-decreasing order and then checking if the first platform is at least d units away from 0.

# CAREFUL: The platforms can be moved to the left or right, but their relative order must be maintained.
# So, if the platform lengths are [1, 2, 1], then the platform lengths can be arranged as [2, 1, 1] or [1, 2, 1] or [1, 1, 2].
# But, the platform lengths cannot be arranged as [1, 1, 2] or [1, 2, 1] or [2, 1, 1].

# CAREFUL: The platforms can touch each other, but they cannot intersect.
# So, if the platform lengths are [1, 2, 1], then the platform lengths can be arranged as [2, 1, 1] or [1, 2, 1] or [1, 1, 2].
# But, the platform lengths cannot be arranged as [1, 2, 1] or [2, 1, 1] or [1, 1, 2].

# CAREFUL: Also, the platforms cannot be moved to the left of 0 or to the right of n+1.

# CAREFUL: Also, you can jump to any position in the range [x + 1; x + d] where x is your current position.
# So, if your current position is x, then you can jump to x + 1, x + 2, ..., x + d.
# But, you can jump only to such cells that belong to some wooden platform.

# CAREFUL: You can assume that cells 0 and n+1 belong to wooden platforms.

# CAREFUL: You should move platforms until you start jumping (in other words, you first move the platforms and then start jumping).

# CAREFUL: You want to know if it is possible to reach n+1 from 0 if you can move any platform to the left or to the right arbitrary number of times (possibly, zero) as long as they do not intersect each other (but two platforms can touch each other). It also means that you cannot change the relative order of platforms.
