"""
You are given an integer sequence $1, 2, \dots, n$. You have to divide it into two sets $A$ and $B$ in such a way that each element belongs to exactly one set and $|sum(A) - sum(B)|$ is minimum possible.

The value $|x|$ is the absolute value of $x$ and $sum(S)$ is the sum of elements of the set $S$.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains one integer $n$ ($1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^9$).


-----Output-----

Print one integer â€” the minimum possible value of $|sum(A) - sum(B)|$ if you divide the initial sequence $1, 2, \dots, n$ into two sets $A$ and $B$.


-----Examples-----
Input
3

Output
0

Input
5

Output
1

Input
6

Output
1



-----Note-----

Some (not all) possible answers to examples:

In the first example you can divide the initial sequence into sets $A = \{1, 2\}$ and $B = \{3\}$ so the answer is $0$.

In the second example you can divide the initial sequence into sets $A = \{1, 3, 4\}$ and $B = \{2, 5\}$ so the answer is $1$.

In the third example you can divide the initial sequence into sets $A = \{1, 4, 5\}$ and $B = \{2, 3, 6\}$ so the answer is $1$.
