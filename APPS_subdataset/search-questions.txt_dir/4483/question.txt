## Description
You are a *Fruit Ninja*, your skill is cutting fruit. All the fruit will be cut in half by your knife. For example:

```
[  "apple",     "pear",     "banana"  ]  --> ["app", "le", "pe", "ar", "ban", "ana"]
```
As you see, all fruits are cut in half. You should pay attention to `"apple"`: if you cannot cut a fruit into equal parts, then the first part will has a extra character.

You should only cut the fruit, other things **should not be cut**, such as the `"bomb"`:
```
[  "apple",     "pear",     "banana",   "bomb"]  -->
["app", "le", "pe", "ar", "ban", "ana", "bomb"]
```

The valid fruit names are preloded for you as:
```python
FRUIT_NAMES
```
