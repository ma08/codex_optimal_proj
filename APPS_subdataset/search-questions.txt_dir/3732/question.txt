A Madhav array has the following property:

```a[0] = a[1] + a[2] = a[3] + a[4] + a[5] = a[6] + a[7] + a[8] + a[9] = ...```

Complete the function/method that returns `true` if the given array is a Madhav array, otherwise it returns `false`.

*Edge cases: An array of length* `0` *or* `1` *should not be considered a Madhav array as there is nothing to compare.*
