Example to identify the pattern :
Input                            Output
9                                   36
5                                   10
1                                    0
2                                    1

-----Input:-----
- First-line will contain $T$, the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow. 
- Each test case contains a single line of input, $N$. 

-----Output:-----
For each test case, output in a single line answer as displayed on the screen.

-----Constraints-----
- $1 \leq T \leq 10^6$
- $1 \leq N \leq 10^6$

-----Sample Input:-----

7

-----Sample Output:-----
21
