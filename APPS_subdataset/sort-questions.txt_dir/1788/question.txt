This kata explores writing an AI for a two player, turn based game called *NIM*.

The Board
--------------

The board starts out with several piles of straw.  Each pile has a random number of straws.

```
Pile 0: ||||

Pile 1: ||

Pile 2: |||||

Pile 3: |

Pile 4: ||||||

...or more concisely: [4,2,5,1,6]
```

The Rules
--------------

- The players take turns picking a pile, and removing any number of straws from the pile they pick
- A player must pick at least one straw
- If a player picks the last straw, she wins!

The Task
------------

In this kata, you have to write an AI to play the straw picking game.

You have to encode an AI in a function `choose_move` (or `chooseMove`, or `choose-move`) that takes a board, represented as a list of positive integers, and returns

```python
(pile_index, number_of_straws)
```

Which refers to an index of a pile on the board, and some none-zero number of straws to draw from that pile.

The test suite is written so that your AI is expected to play 50 games and win every game it plays.
