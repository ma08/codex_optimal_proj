# Task
 Mr.Odd is my friend. Some of his common dialogues are “Am I looking odd?” , “It’s looking very odd” etc. Actually “odd” is his favorite word.

 In this valentine when he went to meet his girlfriend. But he forgot to take gift. Because of this he told his gf that he did an odd thing. His gf became angry and gave him punishment.

 His gf gave him a string str of contain only lowercase letter and told him,
 
 “You have to take 3 index `i,j,k` such that `i ".u..dbo"(no more odd)`
 
 For `str="ooudddbd"`, the result should be `2`.
 
 `"ooudddbd"(cut 1st odd)--> ".ou..dbd"(cut 2nd odd) --> "..u...b."`
