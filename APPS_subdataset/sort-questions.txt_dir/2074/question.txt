You've got array A, consisting of n integers and a positive integer k. Array A is indexed by integers from 1 to n.

You need to permute the array elements so that value $\sum_{i = 1}^{n - k}|A [ i ] - A [ i + k ]|$ became minimal possible. In particular, it is allowed not to change order of elements at all.


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers n, k (2 ≤ n ≤ 3·10^5, 1 ≤ k ≤ min(5000, n - 1)). 

The second line contains n integers A[1], A[2], ..., A[n] ( - 10^9 ≤ A[i] ≤ 10^9), separate by spaces — elements of the array A.


-----Output-----

Print the minimum possible value of the sum described in the statement.


-----Examples-----
Input
3 2
1 2 4

Output
1

Input
5 2
3 -5 3 -5 3

Output
0

Input
6 3
4 3 4 3 2 5

Output
3



-----Note-----

In the first test one of the optimal permutations is 1 4 2. 

In the second test the initial order is optimal. 

In the third test one of the optimal permutations is 2 3 4 4 3 5.
