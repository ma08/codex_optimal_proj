You think you can code?

 This problem will test you on various basic programming techniques.

 You are given two integers $N$ and $t$; and then an array $A$ of $N$ integers ($0$-based indexing).

 Based on the value of $t$, you will perform an action on $A$.

$t$

Action Needed

$1$

Print $7$, regardless of the content of $A$

$2$

Print “Bigger” if $A[0] > A[1]$, or 

Print “Equal” if $A[0] == A[1]$, or 

Print “Smaller” otherwise (without the quotes); 

Ignore other indices of $A$, if any

$3$

Print the median of three integers {$A[0]$, $A[1]$, and $A[2]$}; 

Ignore other indices of $A$, if any

$4$

Print the sum of all integers in $A$

$5$

Print the sum of all even integers in $A$

$6$

Apply modulo (%) $26$ to each integer in $A$, 

Map integer $0$/$1$/$\ldots $/$25$ to character ‘a’/‘b’/$\ldots $/‘z’, 

Finally, print the sequence of characters as a string (without the spaces)

$7$

a. Start from index $i = 0$; 

b. Jump to index $i = A[i]$; 

c. If the current index $i$ is outside the valid bound of [0..$N$-1], print “Out” and stop; 

d. Else if the current index $i$ is index $N$-$1$, print “Done” and stop; 

e1. Otherwise, repeat step b; 

e2. If doing this leads to an infinite loop, print “Cyclic” and stop; 

(all output are without the quotes)

-----Input-----
The first line of the input contains an integer $N$ and $t$ ($3 \leq N \leq 200000$; $1 \leq t \leq 7$).

 The second line of the input contains $N$ non-negative $32$-bit signed integers.

-----Output-----
For each test case, output the required answer based on the value of $t$.

-----Scoring-----
There are $20$ hidden test cases that test various requirements of this problem.

 All $20$ test cases will be tested.

 Each hidden test case worth $5$ points (the $7$ sample test cases below worth $0$ point).
