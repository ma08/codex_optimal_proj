You think you can code?

 This problem will test you on various basic programming techniques.

 You are given two integers $N$ and $t$; and then an array $A$ of $N$ integers ($0$-based indexing).

 Based on the value of $t$, you will perform an action on $A$.

$t$

Action Needed

$1$

Print “Yes” if there are two integers $x \in A$ and $y \in A$ such that $x \neq y$ and $x+y = 7777$, 

or “No” otherwise (without the quotes)

$2$

Print “Unique” if all integers in $A$ are different; 

or print “Contains duplicate” otherwise (without the quotes)

$3$

Find and print the integer that appears $> \frac{N}{2}$ times in $A$; 

or print $-1$ if such integer cannot be found

$4$

Find and print the median integer of $A$ if $N$ is odd; 

or print both median integers of $A$ if $N$ is even (separate them with a single space)

$5$

Print integers in $A$ that fall between a range [$100 \ldots 999$] in sorted order; 

(print a single space between two integers)

-----Input-----
The first line of the input contains an integer $N$ and $t$ ($3 \leq N \leq 200000$; $1 \leq t \leq 5$).

 The second line of the input contains $N$ non-negative $32$-bit signed integers.

-----Output-----
For each test case, output the required answer based on the value of $t$.

-----Scoring-----
There are $20$ hidden test cases that test various requirements of this problem.

 All $20$ test cases will be tested.

 Each hidden test case worth $5$ points (the $5$ sample test cases below worth $0$ point).
