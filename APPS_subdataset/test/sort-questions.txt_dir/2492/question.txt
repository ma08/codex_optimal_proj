We have N integers A_1, A_2, ..., A_N.
There are \frac{N(N-1)}{2} ways to choose two of them and form a pair. If we compute the product of each of those pairs and sort the results in ascending order, what will be the K-th number in that list?

-----Constraints-----
 - All values in input are integers.
 - 2 \leq N \leq 2 \times 10^5
 - 1 \leq K \leq \frac{N(N-1)}{2}
 - -10^9 \leq A_i \leq 10^9\ (1 \leq i \leq N)

-----Input-----
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N K
A_1 A_2 \dots A_N

-----Output-----
Print the answer.

-----Sample Input-----
4 3
3 3 -4 -2

-----Sample Output-----
-6

There are six ways to form a pair. The products of those pairs are 9, -12, -6, -12, -6, 8.
Sorting those numbers in ascending order, we have -12, -12, -6, -6, 8, 9. The third number in this list is -6.
