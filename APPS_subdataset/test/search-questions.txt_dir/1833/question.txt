You are given an integer array $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$.

The array $b$ is called to be a subsequence of $a$ if it is possible to remove some elements from $a$ to get $b$.

Array $b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_k$ is called to be good if it is not empty and for every $i$ ($1 \le i \le k$) $b_i$ is divisible by $i$.

Find the number of good subsequences in $a$ modulo $10^9 + 7$. 

Two subsequences are considered different if index sets of numbers included in them are different. That is, the values ​of the elements ​do not matter in the comparison of subsequences. In particular, the array $a$ has exactly $2^n - 1$ different subsequences (excluding an empty subsequence).


-----Input-----

The first line contains an integer $n$ ($1 \le n \le 100\,000$) — the length of the array $a$.

The next line contains integers $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$ ($1 \le a_i \le 10^6$).


-----Output-----

Print exactly one integer — the number of good subsequences taken modulo $10^9 + 7$.


-----Examples-----

2
1 2

Output
3
Input
5
2 2 1 22 14

Output
13


-----Note-----

In the first example, all three non-empty possible subsequences are good: $\{1\}$, $\{1, 2\}$, $\{2\}$

In the second example, the possible good subsequences are: $\{2\}$, $\{2, 2\}$, $\{2, 22\}$, $\{2, 14\}$, $\{2\}$, $\{2, 22\}$, $\{2, 14\}$, $\{1\}$, $\{1, 22\}$, $\{1, 14\}$, $\{22\}$, $\{22, 14\}$, $\{14\}$.

Note, that some subsequences are listed more than once, since they occur in the original array multiple times.
