Arpa is researching the Mexican wave.

There are n spectators in the stadium, labeled from 1 to n. They start the Mexican wave at time 0. 

  At time 1, the first spectator stands.  At time 2, the second spectator stands.  ...  At time k, the k-th spectator stands.  At time k + 1, the (k + 1)-th spectator stands and the first spectator sits.  At time k + 2, the (k + 2)-th spectator stands and the second spectator sits.  ...  At time n, the n-th spectator stands and the (n - k)-th spectator sits.  At time n + 1, the (n + 1 - k)-th spectator sits.  ...  At time n + k, the n-th spectator sits. 

Arpa wants to know how many spectators are standing at time t.


-----Input-----

The first line contains three integers n, k, t (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, 1 ≤ k ≤ n, 1 ≤ t < n + k).


-----Output-----

Print single integer: how many spectators are standing at time t.


-----Examples-----

Input
10 5 12

Output
3



-----Note-----

In the following a sitting spectator is represented as -, a standing spectator is represented as ^.

  At t = 0  ---------- $\Rightarrow$ number of standing spectators = 0.  At t = 1  ^--------- $\Rightarrow$ number of standing spectators = 1.  At t = 2  ^^-------- $\Rightarrow$ number of standing spectators = 2.  At t = 3  ^^^------- $\Rightarrow$ number of standing spectators = 3.  At t = 4  ^^^^------ $\Rightarrow$ number of standing spectators = 4.  At t = 5  ^^^^^----- $\Rightarrow$ number of standing spectators = 5.  At t = 6  -^^^^^---- $\Rightarrow$ number of standing spectators = 5.  At t = 7  --^^^^^--- $\Rightarrow$ number of standing spectators = 5.  At t = 8  ---^^^^^-- $\Rightarrow$ number of standing spectators = 5.  At t = 9  ----^^^^^- $\Rightarrow$ number of standing spectators = 5.  At t = 10 -----^^^^^ $\Rightarrow$ number of standing spectators = 5.  At t = 11 ------^^^^ $\Rightarrow$ number of standing spectators = 4.  At t = 12 -------^^^ $\Rightarrow$ number of standing spectators = 3.  At t = 13 --------^^ $\Rightarrow$ number of standing spectators = 2.  At t = 14 ---------^ $\Rightarrow$ number of standing spectators = 1.  At t = 15 ---------- $\Rightarrow$ number of standing spectators = 0.
