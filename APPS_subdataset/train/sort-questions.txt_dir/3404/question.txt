In this Kata, you will be given a string and two indexes (`a` and `b`). Your task is to reverse the portion of that string between those two indices inclusive. 

~~~if-not:fortran
```
solve("codewars",1,5) = "cawedors" -- elements at index 1 to 5 inclusive are "odewa". So we reverse them.
solve("cODEWArs", 1,5) = "cAWEDOrs" -- to help visualize.
```
~~~
~~~if:fortran
```
solve("codewars",2,6) = "cawedors" -- elements at indices 2 to 6 inclusive are "odewa". So we reverse them.
solve("cODEWArs", 2,6) = "cAWEDOrs" -- to help visualize.
```
~~~

Input will be lowercase and uppercase letters only. 

The first index `a` will always be lower that than the string length; the second index `b` can be greater than the string length. More examples in the test cases. Good luck!
