Convert a hash into an array. Nothing more, Nothing less.

```
{name: 'Jeremy', age: 24, role: 'Software Engineer'}
```
should be converted into

```
[["name", "Jeremy"], ["age", 24], ["role", "Software Engineer"]]
```

```if:python,javascript,crystal
**Note**: The output array should be sorted alphabetically.
```

Good Luck!
