A tree is an undirected connected graph without cycles.

Let's consider a rooted undirected tree with n vertices, numbered 1 through n. There are many ways to represent such a tree. One way is to create an array with n integers p_1, p_2, ..., p_{n}, where p_{i} denotes a parent of vertex i (here, for convenience a root is considered its own parent). [Image] For this rooted tree the array p is [2, 3, 3, 2]. 

Given a sequence p_1, p_2, ..., p_{n}, one is able to restore a tree:  There must be exactly one index r that p_{r} = r. A vertex r is a root of the tree.  For all other n - 1 vertices i, there is an edge between vertex i and vertex p_{i}. 

A sequence p_1, p_2, ..., p_{n} is called valid if the described procedure generates some (any) rooted tree. For example, for n = 3 sequences (1,2,2), (2,3,1) and (2,1,3) are not valid.

You are given a sequence a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n}, not necessarily valid. Your task is to change the minimum number of elements, in order to get a valid sequence. Print the minimum number of changes and an example of a valid sequence after that number of changes. If there are many valid sequences achievable in the minimum number of changes, print any of them.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 200 000) — the number of vertices in the tree.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} (1 ≤ a_{i} ≤ n).


-----Output-----

In the first line print the minimum number of elements to change, in order to get a valid sequence.

In the second line, print any valid sequence possible to get from (a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n}) in the minimum number of changes. If there are many such sequences, any of them will be accepted.


-----Examples-----
Input
4
2 3 3 4

Output
1
2 3 4 4 

Input
5
3 2 2 5 3

Output
0
3 2 2 5 3 

Input
8
2 3 5 4 1 6 6 7

Output
2
2 3 7 8 1 6 6 7



-----Note-----

In the first sample, it's enough to change one element. In the provided output, a sequence represents a tree rooted in a vertex 4 (because p_4 = 4), which you can see on the left drawing below. One of other correct solutions would be a sequence 2 3 3 2, representing a tree rooted in vertex 3 (right drawing below). On both drawings, roots are painted red. [Image] 

In the second sample, the given sequence is already valid.
