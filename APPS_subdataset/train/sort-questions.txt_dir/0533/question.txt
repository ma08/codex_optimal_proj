The chef is playing a game of long distance. Chef has a number K and he wants to find the longest distance between the index of the first and the last occurrence of K in a given array of N numbers.

-----Input:-----
- First-line will contain $T$, the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow. 
- Each test case contains two lines of input.
- Next line with Two integers in one line $K, N$.
- Next line with $N$ space-separated integers.

-----Output:-----
For each test case, output in a single line answer as the index of first and last occurrence of K in the given array.
Note: Here Indexing is from 1 not  0 based.

-----Constraints-----
- $1 \leq T \leq 100$
- $1 \leq k \leq 10^5$
- $1 \leq N \leq 10^5$

-----Sample Input:-----
2
2 6
2 3 4 2 1 6
4 6
2 3 4 2 1 6

-----Sample Output:-----
3
0

-----EXPLANATION:-----
For 1) Index of First and last occurrence of 2 in the given array is at 1 and 4, i.e. distance is 3. 
For 2) 4 occurs only once in the given array hence print 0.
