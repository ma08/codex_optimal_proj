In this Kata you need to write the method SharedBits that returns true if 2 integers share at least two '1' bits. For simplicity assume that all numbers are positive

For example
int seven = 7;    //0111
int ten = 10;     //1010
int fifteen = 15; //1111
SharedBits(seven, ten);     //false
SharedBits(seven, fifteen); //true
SharedBits(ten, fifteen);   //true

- seven and ten share only a single '1' (at index 3)
- seven and fifteen share 3 bits (at indexes 1, 2, and 3)
- ten and fifteen  share 2 bits (at indexes 0 and 2)

Hint: you can do this with just string manipulation, but binary operators will make your life much easier.
