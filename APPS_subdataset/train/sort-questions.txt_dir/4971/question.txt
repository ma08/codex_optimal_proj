Linked Lists - Sorted Insert

Write a SortedInsert() function which inserts a node into the correct location of a pre-sorted linked list which is sorted in ascending order. SortedInsert takes the head of a linked list and data used to create a node as arguments. SortedInsert() should also return the head of the list.

The push() and buildOneTwoThree() functions do not need to be redefined.
