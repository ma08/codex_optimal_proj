This challenge is based on [the kata](https://www.codewars.com/kata/n-smallest-elements-in-original-order) by GiacomoSorbi. Before doing this one it is advisable to complete the non-performance version first.

___

# Task

You will be given an array of random integers and a number `n`. You have to extract `n` smallest integers out of it **preserving the original order**.

# Examples

```python
performant_smallest([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], 3)     ==   [1, 2, 3]
performant_smallest([5, 4, 3, 2, 1], 3)     ==   [3, 2, 1]
performant_smallest([1, 2, 3, 4, 1], 3)     ==   [1, 2, 1]
performant_smallest([2, 1, 3, 2, 3], 3)     ==   [2, 1, 2]
```

# Notes

* There will be duplicates in the array, and they have to be returned in the order of their each separate appearence.
* This kata is an example of the "know your data" principle. Remember this while searching for the correct approach.

# Performance tests

```python
Tests: 15
Array size: 800,000
Values range: [1; 50]
Number of elements to return: 25-50% of the array
```
