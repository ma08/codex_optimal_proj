Your task is very simple. Given an input string s, case\_sensitive(s), check whether all letters are lowercase or not. Return True/False and a list of all the entries that are not lowercase in order of their appearance in s.

For example, case\_sensitive('codewars') returns [True, []], but case\_sensitive('codeWaRs') returns [False, ['W', 'R']].


Goodluck :)
