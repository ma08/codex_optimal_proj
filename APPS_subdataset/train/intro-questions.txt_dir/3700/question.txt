A family of kookaburras are in my backyard.

I can't see them all, but I can hear them!

# How many kookaburras are there?




## Hint 

The trick to counting kookaburras is to listen carefully

* The males go ```HaHaHa```...

* The females go ```hahaha```...

* And they always alternate male/female
