In this Kata, you will be given an array of strings and your task is to remove all consecutive duplicate letters from each string in the array.

For example: 

  * `dup(["abracadabra","allottee","assessee"]) = ["abracadabra","alote","asese"]`. 
  
  * `dup(["kelless","keenness"]) = ["keles","kenes"]`.

Strings will be lowercase only, no spaces. See test cases for more examples.

~~~if:rust
For the sake of simplicity you can use the macro 'vec_of_string' to create a Vec with an array of string literals.

Good luck!
