An integral:
  


can be approximated by the so-called Simpsonâ€™s rule:




Here `h = (b-a)/n`, `n` being an even integer and `a <= b`. 

We want to try Simpson's rule with the function f:



The task is to write a function called `simpson` with parameter `n` which returns the value of the integral of f on the interval `[0, pi]` (pi being 3.14159265359...).
## Notes:
- Don't round or truncate your results. See in "RUN EXAMPLES" the function `assertFuzzyEquals` or `testing`.
- `n` will always be even.

- We know that the exact value of the integral of f on the given interval is `2`.
