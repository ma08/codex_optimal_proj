In this kata, your task is to write a function `to_bytes(n)` (or `toBytes(n)` depending on language) that produces a list of bytes that represent a given non-negative integer `n`. Each byte in the list is represented by a string of `'0'` and `'1'` of length 8. The most significant byte is first in the list. The example test cases should provide you with all the details. You may assume that the argument `n` is valid.
