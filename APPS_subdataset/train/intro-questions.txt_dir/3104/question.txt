Santa puts all the presents into the huge sack. In order to let his reindeers rest a bit, he only takes as many reindeers with him as he is required to do. The others may take a nap.

Two reindeers are always required for the sleigh and Santa himself. Additionally he needs 1 reindeer per 30 presents. As you know, Santa has 8 reindeers in total, so he can deliver up to 180 presents at once (2 reindeers for Santa and the sleigh + 6 reindeers with 30 presents each).

Complete the function `reindeers()`, which takes a number of presents and returns the minimum numbers of required reindeers. If the number of presents is too high, throw an error.

Examles:

```python
reindeer(0) # must return 2
reindeer(1) # must return 3
reindeer(30) # must return 3
reindeer(200) # must throw an error
```
