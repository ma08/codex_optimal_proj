Santa is coming to town and he needs your help finding out who's been naughty or nice. You will be given an entire year of JSON data following this format:

Your function should return `"Naughty!"` or `"Nice!"` depending on the total number of occurrences in a given year (whichever one is greater). If both are equal, return `"Nice!"`
