An array is said to be `hollow` if it contains `3` or more `0`s in the middle that are preceded and followed by the same number of non-zero elements. Furthermore, all the zeroes in the array must be in the middle of the array. 

Write a function named `isHollow`/`is_hollow`/`IsHollow` that accepts an integer array and returns `true` if it is a hollow array,else `false`.
