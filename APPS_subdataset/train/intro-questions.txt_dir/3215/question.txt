## Number pyramid

Number pyramid is a recursive structure where each next row is constructed by adding adjacent values of the current row. For example:

```
Row 1     [1     2     3     4]
Row 2        [3     5     7]
Row 3           [8    12]
Row 4             [20]
```

___

## Task

Given the first row of the number pyramid, find the value stored in its last row.

## Examples

```python
reduce_pyramid([1])        ==  1
reduce_pyramid([3, 5])     ==  8
reduce_pyramid([3, 9, 4])  ==  25
```
