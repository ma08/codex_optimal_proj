Create a program that will take in a string as input and, if there are duplicates of more than two alphabetical characters in the string, returns the string with all the extra characters in a bracket.

For example, the input "aaaabbcdefffffffg" should return  "aa[aa]bbcdeff[fffff]g" 

Please also ensure that the input is a string, and return "Please enter a valid string" if it is not.
