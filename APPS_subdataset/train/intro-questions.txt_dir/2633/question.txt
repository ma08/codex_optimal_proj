Note that K is indexed from 0 to M-1, where M is the number of attributes.
Note: If two attributes are the same for different rows, for example, if two atheletes are of the same age, print the row that appeared first in the input.

=====Input Format=====
The first line contains N and M separated by a space.
The next N lines each contain M elements.
The last line contains K.

=====Constraints=====
1≤N,M≤1000
0≤K≤M
Each element ≤ 1000

=====Output Format=====
Print the N lines of the sorted table. Each line should contain the space separated elements. Check the sample below for clarity.
