The alphabetized kata
---------------------

Re-order the characters of a string, so that they are concatenated into a new string in "case-insensitively-alphabetical-order-of-appearance" order. Whitespace and punctuation shall simply be removed!

The input is restricted to contain no numerals and only words containing the english alphabet letters.

Example: 

```python
alphabetized("The Holy Bible") # "BbeehHilloTy"
```
