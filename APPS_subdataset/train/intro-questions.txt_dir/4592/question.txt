Regular Tic-Tac-Toe is boring.

That's why in this Kata you will be playing  Tic-Tac-Toe in **3D** using a 4 x 4 x 4 matrix!



# Kata Task

Play the game. Work out who wins.

Return a string

* `O wins after  moves`
* `X wins after  moves`
* `No winner`

# Rules

* Player `O` always goes first
* Input `moves` is list/array/tuple of `[x,y,z]` (zero based)
* Each player takes a turn until you find a winner, or there are no moves left
* Four of the same symbols in a row wins
* There may be more moves provided than are necessary to finish the game - that is for you to figure out



Good Luck!
