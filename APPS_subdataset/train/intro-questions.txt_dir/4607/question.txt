Given a certain number, how many multiples of three could you obtain with its digits?

Suposse that you have the number 362. The numbers that can be generated from it are:
```
362 ----> 3, 6, 2, 36, 63, 62, 26, 32, 23, 236, 263, 326, 362, 623, 632 
```
But only:

```3, 6, 36, 63``` are multiple of three.

We need a function that can receive a number ann may output in the following order:

- the amount of multiples

- the maximum multiple

Let's see a case the number has a the digit 0 and repeated digits:
```
6063 ----> 0, 3, 6, 30, 36, 60, 63, 66, 306, 360, 366, 603, 606, 630, 636, 660, 663, 3066, 3606, 3660, 6036, 6063, 6306, 6360, 6603, 6630
```
In this case the multiples of three will be all except 0

```
6063 ----> 3, 6, 30, 36, 60, 63, 66, 306, 360, 366, 603, 606, 630, 636, 660, 663, 3066, 3606, 3660, 6036, 6063, 6306, 6360, 6603, 6630
```

The cases above for the function:
```python
find_mult_3(362) == [4, 63]

find_mult_3(6063) == [25, 6630]
```
In Javascript ```findMult_3()```.
The function will receive only positive integers (num > 0), and you don't have to worry for validating the entries.

Features of the random tests:
```
Number of test = 100
1000 ≤ num ≤ 100000000
```
Enjoy it!!
