Write a class Random that does the following:

1. Accepts a seed
```python
>>> random = Random(10)
>>> random.seed
10
```

2. Gives a random number between 0 and 1
```python
>>> random.random()
0.347957
>>> random.random()
0.932959
```

3. Gives a random int from a range
```python
>>> random.randint(0, 100)
67
>>> random.randint(0, 100)
93
```

Modules `random` and `os` are forbidden.
