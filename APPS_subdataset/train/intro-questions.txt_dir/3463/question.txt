Write a function `sumTimesTables` which sums the result of the sums of the elements specified in `tables` multiplied by all the numbers in between `min` and `max` including themselves.

For example, for `sumTimesTables([2,5],1,3)` the result should be the same as
```
2*1 + 2*2 + 2*3 +
5*1 + 5*2 + 5*3
```
i.e. the table of two from 1 to 3 plus the table of five from 1 to 3

All the numbers are integers but you must take in account:

* `tables` could be empty.
* `min` could be negative.
* `max` could be really big.
