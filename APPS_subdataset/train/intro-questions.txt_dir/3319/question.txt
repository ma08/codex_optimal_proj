Complete the method/function so that it converts dash/underscore delimited words into camel casing. The first word within the output should be capitalized **only** if the original word was capitalized (known as Upper Camel Case, also often referred to as Pascal case). 

## Examples

```python
to_camel_case("the-stealth-warrior") # returns "theStealthWarrior"

to_camel_case("The_Stealth_Warrior") # returns "TheStealthWarrior"
```
