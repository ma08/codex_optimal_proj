# Let's watch a parade!
## Brief
You're going to watch a parade, but you only care about one of the groups marching. The parade passes through the street where your house is. Your house is at number `location` of the street. Write a function `parade_time` that will tell you the times when you need to appear to see all appearences of that group.

## Specifications
You'll be given:

* A `list` of `string`s containing `groups` in the parade, in order of appearance. A group may appear multiple times. You want to see all the parts of your favorite group.
* An positive `integer` with the `location` on the parade route where you'll be watching.
* An positive `integer` with the `speed` of the parade
* A `string` with the `pref`ferred group you'd like to see

You need to return the time(s) you need to be at the parade to see your favorite group as a `list` of `integer`s.

It's possible the group won't be at your `location` at an exact `time`. In that case, just be sure to get there right before it passes (i.e. the largest integer `time` before the float passes the `position`).

## Example
```python
groups = ['A','B','C','D','E','F']
location = 3
speed = 2
pref = 'C'
                  v
Locations: |0|1|2|3|4|5|6|7|8|9|...
F E D C B A      | |               time = 0
> > F E D C B A  | |               time = 1
    > > F E D C B|A|               time = 2
        > > F E D|C|B A            time = 3
                  ^
parade_time(['A','B','C','D','E','F'], 3, 2,'C']) == [3]
```
