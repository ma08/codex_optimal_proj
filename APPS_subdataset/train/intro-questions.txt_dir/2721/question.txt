The task is very simple.

You must to return pyramids. Given a number ```n```  you print a pyramid with ```n``` floors

For example , given a ```n=4``` you must to print this pyramid:

```
   /\
  /  \
 /    \
/______\ 
   
```

Other example, given a ```n=6``` you must to print this pyramid:

```  
     /\
    /  \
   /    \
  /      \
 /        \
/__________\

```

Another example, given a ```n=10```, you must to print this pyramid:

```
         /\
        /  \
       /    \
      /      \
     /        \
    /          \
   /            \
  /              \
 /                \
/__________________\

```

Note: an extra line feed character is needed at the end of the string. Case `n=0` should so return `"\n"`.
