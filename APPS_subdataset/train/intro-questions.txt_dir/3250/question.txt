Bob is a theoretical coder - he doesn't write code, but comes up with theories, formulas and algorithm ideas. You are his secretary, and he has tasked you with writing the code for his newest project - a method for making the short form of a word. Write a function ```shortForm```(C# ```ShortForm```, Python ```short_form```) that takes a string and returns it converted into short form using the rule: Remove all vowels, except for those that are the first or last letter. Do not count 'y' as a vowel, and ignore case. Also note, the string given will not have any spaces; only one word, and only Roman letters. 

Example:
```
shortForm("assault");
short_form("assault")
ShortForm("assault");
// should return "asslt"
```

 
Also, FYI: I got all the words with no vowels from
