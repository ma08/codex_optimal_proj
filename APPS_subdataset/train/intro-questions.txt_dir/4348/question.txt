Just another day in the world of Minecraft, Steve is getting ready to start his next exciting project -- building a railway system!

But first, Steve needs to melt some iron ores in the furnace to get the main building blocks of rails -- iron ingots. ![Alt text](http://www.blocksandgold.com/media/catalog/product/cache/3/image/35x/cbcbef48e5e3bcce7c7ed908f20bc5b4/i/r/ironingot_icon32.png)

Each iron ingot takes 11 seconds* to produce. Steve needs a lot of them, and he has the following fuel options to add into the furnace: 

* Buckets of lava, each lasts 800 seconds* ![Alt text](http://www.minecraftguides.org/images/items/bucketL.gif)
* Blaze rod, each lasts 120 seconds ![Alt text](http://www.minecraftguides.org/images/items/blazerod.gif)
* Coals, each lasts 80 seconds ![Alt text](http://www.minecraftguides.org/images/items/coal.gif)
* Blocks of Wood, each lasts 15 seconds ![Alt text](http://www.minecraftguides.org/images/itemGifs/logs.gif)
* Sticks, each lasts 1 second* ![Alt text](http://www.minecraftguides.org/images/items/stick.gif)

In Ruby: 
Write a function `calc_fuel` that calculates the **minimum** amount of fuel needed to produce a certain number of iron ingots. This function should return a hash of the form `{:lava => 2, :blaze_rod => 1, :coal => 1, :wood => 0, :stick => 0}`
In JavaScript:
Write a function `calcFuel` that calculates the **minimum** amount of fuel needed to produce a certain number of iron ingots. This function should return an object of the form `{lava: 2, blazeRod: 1, coal: 1, wood: 0, stick: 0}`
In Python:
Write a function `calc_fuel` that calculates the **minimum** amount of fuel needed to produce a certain number of iron ingots. This function should return a dictionary of the form `{"lava": 2, "blaze rod": 1, "coal": 1, "wood": 0, "stick": 0}`

To all the Minecraft players out there: 
feel free to expand this series or let me know if you have any ideas related to Minecraft that can be turned into codewars puzzles. Some ideas I have that might potentially be turned into katas:

* distance traveled in real world vs. in Nether
* shortest path problems related to mining diamonds/gold/goodies that appears in different levels under ground
* growth of animal population from breeding
* redstone stuff?!

If you do end up expanding this series, please send me a link of your kata so I can check it out and include a link to your kata here :-)
