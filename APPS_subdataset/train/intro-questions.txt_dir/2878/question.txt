Given a string `S` and a character `C`, return an array of integers representing the shortest distance from the current character in `S` to `C`.

### Notes

* All letters will be lowercase.
* If the string is empty, return an empty array.
* If the character is not present, return an empty array.

## Examples

```python
shortest_to_char("lovecodewars", "e") == [3, 2, 1, 0, 1, 2, 1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
shortest_to_char("aaaabbbb", "b") == [4, 3, 2, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]
shortest_to_char("", "b") == []
shortest_to_char("abcde", "") == []
```
