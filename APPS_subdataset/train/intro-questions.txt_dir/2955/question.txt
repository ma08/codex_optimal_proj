Some integral numbers are odd. All are more odd, or less odd, than others.

Even numbers satisfy `n = 2m` ( with `m` also integral ) and we will ( completely arbitrarily ) think of odd numbers as `n = 2m + 1`.  
Now, some odd numbers can be more odd than others: when for some `n`, `m` is more odd than for another's. Recursively. :]  
Even numbers are always less odd than odd numbers, but they also can be more, or less, odd than other even numbers, by the same mechanism.

# Task

Given a _non-empty_ finite list of _unique_ integral ( not necessarily non-negative ) numbers, determine the number that is _odder than the rest_.  
Given the constraints, there will always be exactly one such number.

# Examples

```python
oddest([1,2]) => 1
oddest([1,3]) => 3
oddest([1,5]) => 5
```
