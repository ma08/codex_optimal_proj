=====Problem Statement=====
ABC is a right triangle, 90°, at B. Therefore, ANGLE{ABC} = 90°.
Point M is the midpoint of hypotenuse AC.
You are given the lengths AB and BC.
Your task is to find ANGLE{MBC} (angle θ°, as shown in the figure) in degrees.

=====Input Format=====
The first contains the length of side AB.
The second line contains the length of side BC.

=====Constraints=====
0<AB≤100
0<BC≤100
Lengths AB and BC are natural numbers.

=====Output Format=====
Output ANGLE{MBC} in degrees.
Note: Round the angle to the nearest integer.
Examples:
If angle is 56.5000001°, then output 57°.
If angle is 56.5000000°, then output 57°.
If angle is 56.4999999°, then output 56°.
