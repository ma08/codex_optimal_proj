Your task is to write function which takes string and list of delimiters as an input and returns list of strings/characters after splitting given string.

Example:
```python
multiple_split('Hi, how are you?', [' ']) => ['Hi,', 'how', 'are', 'you?']
multiple_split('1+2-3', ['+', '-']) => ['1', '2', '3']
```

List of delimiters is optional and can be empty, so take that into account.

Important note: Result cannot contain empty string.
