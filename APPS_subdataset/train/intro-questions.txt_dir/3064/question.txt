Transpose means is to interchange rows and columns of a two-dimensional array matrix.

[A^(T)]ij=[A]ji

ie:
Formally, the i th row, j th column element of AT is the j th row, i th column element of A:



Example :

```
[[1,2,3],[4,5,6]].transpose() //should return [[1,4],[2,5],[3,6]]
```

Write a prototype transpose to array in JS or add a .transpose method in Ruby or create a transpose function in Python so that any matrix of order ixj 2-D array returns transposed Matrix of jxi .
