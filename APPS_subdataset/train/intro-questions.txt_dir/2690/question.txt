Remove the parentheses
=
In this kata you are given a string for example:

```python
"example(unwanted thing)example"
```

Your task is to remove everything inside the parentheses as well as the parentheses themselves.

The example above would return:

```python
"exampleexample"
```

Other than parentheses only letters and spaces can occur in the string. Don't worry about other brackets like ```"[]"``` and ```"{}"``` as these will never appear.
