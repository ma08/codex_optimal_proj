Following on from [Part 1](http://www.codewars.com/kata/filling-an-array-part-1/), part 2 looks at some more complicated array contents.

So let's try filling an array with...

## ...square numbers
The numbers from `1` to `n*n`

## ...a range of numbers
A range of numbers starting from `start` and increasing by `step`

## ...random numbers
A bunch of random integers between `min` and `max`

## ...prime numbers
All primes starting from `2` (obviously)...

HOTE: All the above functions should take as their first parameter a number that determines the length of the returned array.
