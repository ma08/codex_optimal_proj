Given a non-negative number, return the next bigger polydivisible number, or an empty value like `null` or `Nothing`.

A number is polydivisible if its first digit is cleanly divisible by `1`, its first two digits by `2`, its first three by `3`, and so on. There are finitely many polydivisible numbers.
