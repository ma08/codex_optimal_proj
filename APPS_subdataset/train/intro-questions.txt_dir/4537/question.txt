Gray code is a form of binary encoding where transitions between consecutive numbers differ by only one bit. This is a useful encoding for reducing hardware data hazards with values that change rapidly and/or connect to slower hardware as inputs. It is also useful for generating inputs for Karnaugh maps.

Here is an exemple of what the code look like:

```
0:    0000
1:    0001
2:    0011
3:    0010
4:    0110
5:    0111
6:    0101
7:    0100
8:    1100
```

The goal of this kata is to build two function bin2gray and gray2bin wich will convert natural binary to Gray Code and vice-versa. We will use the "binary reflected Gray code". The input and output will be arrays of 0 and 1, MSB at index 0.

There are "simple" formula to implement these functions. It is a very interesting exercise to find them by yourself.

All input will be correct binary arrays.
