In this Kata, you're to complete the function `sum_square_even_root_odd`.

You will be given a list of numbers, `nums`, as the only argument to the function. Take each number in the list and *square* it if it is even, or *square root* the number if it is odd. Take this new list and find the *sum*, rounding to two decimal places.

The list will never be empty and will only contain values that are greater than or equal to zero.

Good luck!
