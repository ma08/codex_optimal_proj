Program the function distance(p1, p2) which returns the distance between the points p1 and p2 in n-dimensional space. p1 and p2 will be given as arrays.

Your program should work for all lengths of arrays, and should return -1 if the arrays aren't of the same length or if both arrays are empty sets.

If you don't know how to measure the distance between two points, go here:
