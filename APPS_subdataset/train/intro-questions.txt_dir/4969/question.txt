Build Tower Advanced
---

Build Tower by the following given arguments:
__number of floors__ (integer and always greater than 0)
__block size__ (width, height) (integer pair and always greater than (0, 0))

Tower block unit is represented as `*`

* Python: return a `list`;
* JavaScript: returns an `Array`;

Have fun!
***

for example, a tower of 3 floors with block size = (2, 3) looks like below
```
[
  '    **    ',
  '    **    ',
  '    **    ',
  '  ******  ',
  '  ******  ',
  '  ******  ',
  '**********',
  '**********',
  '**********'
]
```
and a tower of 6 floors with block size = (2, 1) looks like below
```
[
  '          **          ', 
  '        ******        ', 
  '      **********      ', 
  '    **************    ', 
  '  ******************  ', 
  '**********************'
]
```
