Passer ratings are the generally accepted standard for evaluating NFL quarterbacks.
I knew a rating of 100 is pretty good, but never knew what makes up the rating.
So out of curiosity I took a look at the wikipedia page and had an idea or my first kata: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passer_rating

## Formula

There are four parts to the NFL formula:
```python
A = ((Completions / Attempts) - .3) * 5
B = ((Yards / Attempts) - 3) * .25
C = (Touchdowns / Attempt) * 20
D = 2.375 - ((Interceptions / Attempts) * 25)
```
However, if the result of any calculation is greater than `2.375`, it is set to `2.375`. If the result is a negative number, it is set to zero.

Finally the passer rating is: `((A + B + C + D) / 6) * 100`

Return the rating rounded to the nearest tenth.

## Example

Last year Tom Brady had 432 attempts, 3554 yards, 291 completions, 28 touchdowns, and 2 interceptions.
His passer rating was 112.2

Happy coding!
