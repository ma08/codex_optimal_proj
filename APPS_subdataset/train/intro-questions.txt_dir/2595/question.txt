=====Function Descriptions=====
Polar coordinates are an alternative way of representing Cartesian coordinates or Complex Numbers.
A complex number z
z = x + yj
is completely determined by its real part y. Here, j is the imaginary unit.

A polar coordinate (r, φ) is completely determined by modulus r and phase angle φ.
If we convert complex number z to its polar coordinate, we find:
r: Distance from z to origin, i.e., sqrt(x^2 + y^2)
φ: Counter clockwise angle measured from the positive -axis to the line segment that joins z to the origin.

Python's cmath module provides access to the mathematical functions for complex numbers.
cmath.phase
This tool returns the phase of complex number z (also known as the argument of z).
>>> phase(complex(-1.0, 0.0))
3.1415926535897931

abs
This tool returns the modulus (absolute value) of complex number z.
>>> abs(complex(-1.0, 0.0))
1.0

=====Problem Statement=====
You are given a complex z. Your task is to convert it to polar coordinates.

=====Input Format=====
A single line containing the complex number z. Note: complex() function can be used in python to convert the input as a complex number.

=====Constraints=====
Given number is a valid complex number

=====Output Format=====
Output two lines:
The first line should contain the value of r.
The second line should contain the value of φ.
