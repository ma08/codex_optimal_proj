What is the answer to life the universe and everything

Create a function that will make anything true

```python
    anything({}) != [],          'True'
    anything('Hello') < 'World', 'True'
    anything(80) > 81,           'True'
    anything(re) >= re,          'True'
    anything(re) <= math,        'True'
    anything(5) == ord,          'True'
```
