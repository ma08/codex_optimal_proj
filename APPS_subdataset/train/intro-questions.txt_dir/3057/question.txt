A **bouncy number** is a positive integer whose digits neither increase nor decrease. For example, `1235` is an increasing number, `5321` is a decreasing number, and `2351` is a bouncy number. By definition, all numbers under `100` are non-bouncy, and `101` is the first bouncy number. To complete this kata, you must write a function that takes a number and determines if it is bouncy.

Input numbers will always be positive integers, but it never hurts to throw in some error handling : )

For clarification, the bouncy numbers between `100` and `125` are: `101, 102, 103, 104, 105, 106, 107, 108, 109, 120, and 121`.
