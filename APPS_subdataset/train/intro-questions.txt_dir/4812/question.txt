The [Floyd's triangle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floyd%27s_triangle) is a right-angled triangular array of natural numbers listing them in order, in lines of increasing length, so a Floyds triangle of size 6 looks like:

```
1
2  3
4  5  6
7  8  9  10
11 12 13 14 15
16 17 18 19 20 21
    ...
```

In this kata you're given a number, and expected to return the line number it falls in, in the Floyd's triangle

```python
nth_floyd(3) # => 2 (i.e the number `3` falls in line 2 of the triangle)
nth_floyd(17) # => 6

nth_floyd(22) # => 7
nth_floyd(499502) # => 1000
```

```python
nth_floyd(n)
```

## Constraints

### 1 <= n <= 10^(9)
