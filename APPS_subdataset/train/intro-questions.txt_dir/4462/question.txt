# Input >> Output Examples
```
adjacentElementsProduct([1, 2, 3]); ==> return 6
```

## **_Explanation_**:

* **_The maximum product_** *obtained from multiplying* ` 2 * 3 = 6 `, and **_they're adjacent numbers in the array_**.
___
```
adjacentElementsProduct([9, 5, 10, 2, 24, -1, -48]); ==> return 50
```
## **_Explanation_**:
**_Max product_** obtained *from multiplying*   ``` 5 * 10  =  50  ```.
