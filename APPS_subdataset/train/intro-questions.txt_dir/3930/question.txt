You start with a value in dollar form, e.g. $5.00. You must convert this value to a string in which the value is said, like '5 dollars' for example. This should account for ones, cents, zeroes, and negative values. Here are some examples:
```python
dollar_to_speech('$0.00') == '0 dollars.'
dollar_to_speech('$1.00') == '1 dollar.'
dollar_to_speech('$0.01') == '1 cent.'
dollar_to_speech('$5.00') == '5 dollars.'
dollar_to_speech('$20.18') == '20 dollars and 18 cents.'
dollar_to_speech('$-1.00') == 'No negative numbers are allowed!'
```
These examples account for pretty much everything. This kata has many specific outputs, so good luck!
