# Task
 You're given a two-dimensional array of integers `matrix`. Your task is to determine the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in this array.

# Input/Output


 - `[input]` 2D integer array `matrix`

  A non-empty rectangular matrix. 

 `1 ≤ matrix.length ≤ 10`

 `1 ≤ matrix[0].length ≤ 10`


 - `[output]` an integer

  The smallest non-negative integer that is not present in matrix.


# Example

 For 
 
 ```
 matrix = [
 [0, 2],
 [5, 1]]```
 the result should be `3`
 
 0,1,2,`(3)`...5
