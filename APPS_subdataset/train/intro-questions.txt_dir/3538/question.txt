## Story

> "You have serious coding skillz? You wannabe a [scener](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demoscene)? Complete this mission and u can get in teh crew!"

You have read a similar message on your favourite [diskmag](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disk_magazine) back in the early 90s, and got really excited. You contacted the demo crew immediately and they gave you the following job: write a vertical sinus scroller... **for the printer!**

## Your task

Write a function that takes three parameters: `text`, `amp` (for [peak amplitude](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amplitude)) and `period` (or [wavelength](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wavelength)). Return a string (split into multiple lines) that will display the text as a vertical sine wave.

Note: `amp` and `period` are measured in characters and are always positive integers; `text` is never empty.

## Example

```python
>>> scroller('Hello World!', 3, 10)
'   H\n     e\n      l\n      l\n     o\n    \n W\no\nr\n l\n   d\n     !'
```

Doesn't make much sense? Well, let's print it!

```python
   H        1
     e      2
      l     3
      l     4
     o      5
            6
 W          7
o           8
r           9
 l         10
   d        1
     !      2

3210123
```

(Obviously, the numbers are only shown above to demonstrate `amp` and `period`)

Happy coding!

*Note:* due to the inevitable use of floats, solutions with slight rounding errors (1 space difference in less than 10% of the output lines) will be accepted.
