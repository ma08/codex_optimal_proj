# Background

My TV remote control has arrow buttons and an `OK` button.

I can use these to move a "cursor" on a logical screen keyboard to type "words"...

The screen "keyboard" layout looks like this


  #tvkb {
    width : 300px;
    border: 5px solid gray; border-collapse: collapse;
  }
  #tvkb td {
    color : orange;
    background-color : black;
    text-align : right;
    border: 3px solid gray; border-collapse: collapse;
  }

# Kata task

How many button presses on my remote are required to type a given `word`?

## Notes

* The cursor always starts on the letter `a` (top left)
* Remember to also press `OK` to "accept" each character.
* Take a direct route from one character to the next
* The cursor does not wrap (e.g. you cannot leave one edge and reappear on the opposite edge)
* A "word" (for the purpose of this Kata) is any sequence of characters available on my virtual "keyboard" 

# Example

word = `codewars`

* c => `a`-`b`-`c`-OK = 3
* o => `c`-`d`-`e`-`j`-`o`-OK = 5
* d => `o`-`j`-`e`-`d`-OK = 4
* e => `d`-`e`-OK = 2
* w => `e`-`j`-`o`-`t`-`y`-`x`-`w`-OK = 7
* a => `w`-`r`-`m`-`h`-`c`-`b`-`a`-OK = 7
* r => `a`-`f`-`k`-`p`-`q`-`r`-OK = 6
* s => `r`-`s`-OK = 2

Answer = 3 + 5 + 4 + 2 + 7 + 7 + 6 + 2 = 36



*Good Luck!
