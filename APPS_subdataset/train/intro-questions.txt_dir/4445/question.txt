[Haikus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haiku_in_English) are short poems in a three-line format, with 17 syllables arranged in a 5–7–5 pattern. Your task is to check if the supplied text is a haiku or not.


### About syllables

[Syllables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syllable) are the phonological building blocks of words. *In this kata*, a syllable is a part of a word including a vowel ("a-e-i-o-u-y") or a group of vowels (e.g. "ou", "ee", "ay"). A few examples: "tea", "can", "to·day", "week·end", "el·e·phant".

**However**, silent "E"s **do not** create syllables. *In this kata*, an "E" is considered silent if it's alone at the end of the word, preceded by one (or more) consonant(s) and there is at least one other syllable in the word. Examples: "age", "ar·range", "con·crete"; but not in "she", "blue", "de·gree".

Some more examples:
* one syllable words: "cat", "cool", "sprout", "like", "eye", "squeeze"
* two syllables words: "ac·count", "hon·est", "beau·ty", "a·live", "be·cause", "re·store"


## Examples
```
An old silent pond...
A frog jumps into the pond,
splash! Silence again.
```

...should return `True`, as this is a valid 5–7–5 haiku:
```
An old si·lent pond...            # 5 syllables
A frog jumps in·to the pond,      # 7
splash! Si·lence a·gain.          # 5
```

Another example:

```
Autumn moonlight -
a worm digs silently
into the chestnut.
```

...should return `False`, because the number of syllables per line is not correct:
```
Au·tumn moon·light -          # 4 syllables
a worm digs si·lent·ly        # 6
in·to the chest·nut.          # 5
```
