The palindromic number `595` is interesting because it can be written as the sum of consecutive squares: `6^2 + 7^2 + 8^2 + 9^2 + 10^2 + 11^2 + 12^2 = 595`.

There are exactly eleven palindromes below one-thousand that can be written as consecutive square sums. Note that `1 = 0^2 + 1^2` has not been included as this problem is concerned with the squares of positive integers.

Given an input `n`, find the count of all the numbers less than `n` that are both palindromic and can be written as the sum of consecutive squares.

For instance: `values(1000) = 11`. See test examples for more cases.  

Good luck!
