In genetics a reading frame is a way to divide a sequence of nucleotides (DNA bases) into a set of consecutive non-overlapping triplets (also called codon). Each of this triplets is translated into an amino-acid during a translation process to create proteins.

Input
---
In a single strand of DNA you find 3 Reading frames, take for example the following input sequence:

    AGGTGACACCGCAAGCCTTATATTAGC
    
Output
---
For the output we are going to take the combinations and show them in the following manner:

````
Frame 1: AGG TGA CAC CGC AAG CCT TAT ATT AGC
Frame 2: A GGT GAC ACC GCA AGC CTT ATA TTA GC
Frame 3: AG GTG ACA CCG CAA GCC TTA TAT TAG C
````

For frame 1 split all of them in groups of three starting by the first base (letter).

For frame 2 split all of them in groups of three starting by the second base (letter) but having the first base (letter) at the beggining.

For frame 3 split all of them in groups of three starting by the third letter, but having the first and second bases (letters) at the beginning in the same order.
