An array of size N x M represents pixels of an image.
Each cell of this array contains an array of size 3 with the pixel's color information: `[R,G,B]`

Convert the color image, into an *average* greyscale image. 

The `[R,G,B]` array contains integers between 0 and 255 for each color. 

To transform a color pixel into a greyscale pixel, average the values of that pixel:
```
p = [R,G,B] => [(R+G+B)/3, (R+G+B)/3, (R+G+B)/3]
```

**Note:** the values for the pixel must be integers, therefore you should round floats to the nearest integer.

## Example

Here's an example of a 2x2 image: 
 
Here's the expected image after transformation:
