Dee is lazy but she's kind and she likes to eat out at all the nice restaurants and gastropubs in town. To make paying quick and easy she uses a simple mental algorithm she's called The Fair %20 Rule. She's gotten so good she can do this in a few seconds and it always impresses her dates but she's perplexingly still single. Like you probably. 

This is how she does it:

 - She rounds the price `P` at the tens place e.g:
   - 25 becomes 30
   - 24 becomes 20
   - 5 becomes 10
   - 4 becomes 0
 - She figures out the base tip `T` by dropping the singles place digit e.g:
   - when `P = 24` she rounds to 20 drops 0 `T = 2`
   - `P = 115` rounds to 120 drops 0 `T = 12`
   - `P = 25` rounds to 30 drops 0 `T = 3`
   - `P = 5` rounds to 10 drops 0 `T = 1`
   - `P = 4` rounds to 0 `T = 0`
 - She then applies a 3 point satisfaction rating `R` to `T` i.e:
   - When she's satisfied: `R = 1` and she'll add 1 to `T`
   - Unsatisfied: `R = 0` and she'll subtract 1 from `T`
   - Appalled: `R = -1` she'll divide `T` by 2, **rounds down** and subtracts 1
 
## Your Task

Implement a method `calc_tip` that takes two integer arguments for price `p` 

where `1 <= p <= 1000` and a rating `r` which is one of `-1, 0, 1`.

The return value `T` should be a non negative integer.

*Note: each step should be done in the order listed.*

Dee always politely smiles and says "Thank you" on her way out. Dee is nice. Be like Dee.
