Given an array of integers `a` and integers `t` and `x`, count how many elements in the array you can make equal to `t` by **increasing** / **decreasing** it by `x` (or doing nothing).
*EASY!*

```python
# ex 1

a = [11, 5, 3]
t = 7
x = 2

count(a, t, x) # => 3
```
- you can make 11 equal to 7 by subtracting 2 twice
- you can make 5 equal to 7 by adding 2
- you can make 3 equal to 7 by adding 2 twice

```python
# ex 2

a = [-4,6,8]
t = -7
x = -3

count(a, t, x) # => 2
```

## Constraints
**-10^(18) <= a[i],t,x <= 10^(18)**

**3 <= |a| <= 10^(4)**
