Generate and return **all** possible increasing arithmetic progressions of six primes `[a, b, c, d, e, f]` between the given limits. Note: the upper and lower limits are inclusive.

An arithmetic progression is a sequence where the difference between consecutive numbers is the same, such as: 2, 4, 6, 8.

A prime number is a number that is divisible only by itself and 1 (e.g. 2, 3, 5, 7, 11)

Your solutions should be returned as lists inside a list in ascending order of the first item (if there are multiple lists with same first item, return in ascending order for the second item etc) are the e.g: `[ [a, b, c, d, e, f], [g, h, i, j, k, l] ]` where `a < g`. If there are no solutions, return an empty list: `[]`
