Kontti language is a finnish word play game.

You add `-kontti` to the end of each word and then swap their characters until and including the first vowel ("aeiouy"); 

For example the word `tame` becomes `kome-tantti`; `fruity` becomes `koity-fruntti` and so on.

If no vowel is present, the word stays the same.
