Write a program that prints a chessboard with N rows and M columns with the following rules:
The top left cell must be an asterisk (*)
Any cell touching (left, right, up or down) a cell with an asterisk must be a dot (.)
Any cell touching (left, right, up or down) a cell with a dot must be an asterisk.

A chessboard of 8 rows and 8 columns printed using these rules would be:
```
*.*.*.*.
.*.*.*.*
*.*.*.*.
.*.*.*.*
*.*.*.*.
.*.*.*.*
*.*.*.*.
.*.*.*.*
```
Input

A single line with two integers N and M separated by space. The number N will represent the number of rows and M the number of columns.

Output

Return N lines each containing M characters with the chessboard pattern.
Empty string if N, M or both are 0.
