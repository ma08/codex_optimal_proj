There are a **n** balls numbered from 0 to **n-1** (0,1,2,3,etc). Most of them have the same weight, but one is heavier. Your task is to find it.

Your function will receive two arguments - a `scales` object, and a ball count. The `scales` object has only one method:

```python
    get_weight(left, right)
```

where `left` and `right` are arrays of numbers of balls to put on left and right pan respectively.

If the method returns `-1` - left pan is heavier

If the method returns `1` - right pan is heavier

If the method returns `0` - both pans weigh the same

So what makes this the "ubermaster" version of this kata? First, it's not restricted to 8 balls as in the previous versions - your solution has to work for 8-500 balls. 

Second, you can't use the scale any more than mathematically necessary. Here's a chart:

    ball count | uses
    -----------------
           0-9 |    2
         10-27 |    3
         28-81 |    4
        82-243 |    5
       244-500 |    6
