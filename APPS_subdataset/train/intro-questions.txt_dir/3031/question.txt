Your task is very simple. Just write a function `isAlphabetic(s)`, which takes an input string `s` in lowercase and returns `true`/`false` depending on whether the string is in alphabetical order or not.

For example, `isAlphabetic('kata')` is False as 'a' comes after 'k', but `isAlphabetic('ant')` is True.

Good luck :)
