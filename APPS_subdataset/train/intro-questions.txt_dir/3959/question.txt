# Description:

```if:javascript
Given an array `arr` that contains some integers(positive, negative or 0), and a `range` list such as `[[start1,end1],[start2,end2],...]`, start and end are the index of `arr` and start always less than end. Your task is to calculate the sum value of each range (start index and end index are both inclusive), and return the maximum sum value.
```
```if:ruby
Given an array (`arr`) of integers and an array (`ranges`) of ranges (e.g. `[[1, 32], [16, 24],...]`), which represent an index range of `arr`, calculate the sum of each range (start index and end index are both inclusive) of `arr`, and return the maximum sum.
```
```if:php
Given an array `$a` that contains some integers and a `$range` list such as `[[$start1, $end1], [$start2, $end2], ... ]` where `$start(n)` and `$end(n)` are valid keys of the non-associative array `$a` and `$start(n)` is always guaranteed to be strictly less than `$end(n)`.  Your task is to calculate the sum value of each range (start index and end index are both inclusive) and return the maximum sum value.
```
```if:haskell
Given a list `arr` that contains some integers(positive, negative or 0), and a `range` list such as `[(start1,end1),(start2,end2),...]`, start and end are the index of `arr` and start always less than end. Your task is to calculate the sum value of each range (start index and end index are both inclusive), and return the maximum sum value.
```

For example:
 
# Note:

 - `arr`/`$a` always has at least 5 elements;
 - `range`/`$range`/`ranges` always has at least 1 element;
 - All inputs are valid;
