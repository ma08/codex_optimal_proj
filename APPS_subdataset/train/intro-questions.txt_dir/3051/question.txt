The idea for this Kata came from 9gag today.[here](http://9gag.com/gag/amrb4r9)

You'll have to translate a string to Pilot's alphabet (NATO phonetic alphabet) [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO_phonetic_alphabet).

Like this:

**Input:**

`If, you can read?`

**Output:**

`India Foxtrot , Yankee Oscar Uniform Charlie Alfa November Romeo Echo Alfa Delta ?`

**Notes**

* The set of used punctuation is `.!?`.
* Punctuation should be kept in your return string, but spaces should not.
* __Xray__ should not have a dash within.
* Every word and punctuation mark should be seperated by a space ' '.
* There should be no trailing whitespace

Although the proper alphabet for j is `Juliett` you have to use `Juliet` here
