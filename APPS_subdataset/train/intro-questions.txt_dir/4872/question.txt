# Story

You were supposed to implement a node-based calculator. Hopefully for you, a colleague agreed to do the task. When the management saw the code, they were infuriated with its low quality, and as a punishment told you to shorten it as much as possible...

# Task

You will be given a ready solution passing all the fixed and random tests. Unfortunately for you, it is very long and overly repetitive. Current code length is `901` characters. Your task is to shorten it to at most `300` characters.

**Note/hint**: you can modify the implementation any way you want, as long as it is written using only OOP; the sample tests check solution's functionality the same way as the final tests do - if your solution passes the former, it will also pass the latter.
