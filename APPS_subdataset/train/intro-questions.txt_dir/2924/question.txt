Write a program to determine if two numbers are coprime. A pair of numbers are coprime if their greatest shared factor is 1. For example:
```
20 and 27
Factors of 20: 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 20
Factors of 27: 1, 3, 9, 27
Greatest shared factor: 1
20 and 27 are coprime```
An example of two numbers that are not coprime:
```
12 and 39
Factors of 12: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12
Factors of 39: 1, 3, 13, 39
Greatest shared factor: 3
12 and 39 are not coprime```
If the two inputs are coprime, your program should return true. If they are not coprime, your program should return false.

The inputs will always be two positive integers between 2 and 99.
