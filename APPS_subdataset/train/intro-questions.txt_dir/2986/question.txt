You are given a set of `n` segments on the axis `Ox`, each segment has integer endpoints between `0` and `m` inclusive.
 Segments may intersect, overlap or even coincide with each other. Each segment is characterized by two integers li and ri — coordinates of the left and of the right endpoints.

 Consider all integer points between `0` and `m` inclusive. Your task is to print all such points that don't belong to any segment. The point x belongs to the segment `[l;r]` if and only if `l ≤ x ≤ r`.

**Input:**
 `m` — the upper bound for coordinates;
 array of coordinates li and ri `0 ≤ li ≤ ri ≤ m` — the endpoints of the `i`-th segment. Segments may intersect, overlap or even coincide with each other.

**Output:**
 All points from `0` to `m` that don't belong to any segment.

**Examples:**
```python
segments(5, [(2,2),(1,2),(5,5)]) => [0,3,4]
segments(7, [(0,7)]) => []
```
