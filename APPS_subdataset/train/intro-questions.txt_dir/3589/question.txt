Make a function that receives a value, ```val``` and outputs the smallest higher number than the given value, and this number belong to a set of positive integers that have the following properties:

- their digits occur only once

- they are odd

- they are multiple of three

```python
next_numb(12) == 15

next_numb(13) == 15

next_numb(99) == 105

next_numb(999999) == 1023459

next_number(9999999999) == "There is no possible number that
fulfills those requirements"
```

Enjoy the kata!!
