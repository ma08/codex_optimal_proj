Inspired by the development team at Vooza, write the function `howManyLightsabersDoYouOwn`/`how_many_light_sabers_do_you_own` that 

* accepts the name of a programmer, and
* returns the number of lightsabers owned by that person.

The only person who owns lightsabers is Zach, by the way. He owns 18, which is an awesome number of lightsabers. Anyone else owns 0.

```if:coffeescript,javascript,php,python,ruby,typescript
**Note**: your function should have a default parameter.
```

```c#
Kata.HowManyLightsabersDoYouOwn("Adam") == 0
Kata.HowManyLightsabersDoYouOwn("Zach") == 18
```
```python
how_many_light_sabers_do_you_own('Zach') == 18
how_many_light_sabers_do_you_own('Adam') == 0
how_many_light_sabers_do_you_own()       == 0
```
