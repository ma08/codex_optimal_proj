Everyday we go to different places to get our things done. Those places can be represented by specific location points `[ [, ], ... ]` on a map. I will be giving you an array of arrays that contain coordinates of the different places I had been on a particular day. Your task will be to find `peripheries (outermost edges)` of the bounding box that contains all the points. The response should only contain `Northwest and Southeast` points as follows: `{ "nw": [, ], "se": [ , ] }`. You are adviced to draw the points on a 2D plan to visualize:

          |              |  points        |
