# Background

My TV remote control has arrow buttons and an `OK` button.

I can use these to move a "cursor" on a logical screen keyboard to type words...

# Keyboard

The screen "keyboard" layout looks like this


  #tvkb {
    width : 400px;
    border: 5px solid gray; border-collapse: collapse;
  }
  #tvkb td {
    color : orange;
    background-color : black;
    text-align : center;
    border: 3px solid gray; border-collapse: collapse;
  }

* `aA` is the SHIFT key. Pressing this key toggles alpha characters between UPPERCASE and lowercase
* `SP` is the space character
* The other blank keys in the bottom row have no function

# Kata task

How many button presses on my remote are required to type the given `words`?

## Notes

* The cursor always starts on the letter `a` (top left)
* The alpha characters are initially lowercase (as shown above)
* Remember to also press `OK` to "accept" each letter
* Take a direct route from one letter to the next
* The cursor does not wrap (e.g. you cannot leave one edge and reappear on the opposite edge)
* Although the blank keys have no function, you may navigate through them if you want to
* Spaces may occur anywhere in the `words` string.
* Do not press the SHIFT key until you need to. For example, with the word `e.Z`, the SHIFT change happens **after** the `.` is pressed (not before)
 
# Example

words = `Code Wars`

* C => `a`-`f`-`k`-`p`-`u`-`aA`-OK-`U`-`P`-`K`-`F`-`A`-`B`-`C`-OK = 14
* o => `C`-`H`-`M`-`R`-`W`-`V`-`U`-`aA`-OK-`SP`-`v`-`q`-`l`-`m`-`n`-`o`-OK = 16
* d => `o`-`j`-`e`-`d`-OK = 4
* e => `d`-`e`-OK = 2
* space => `e`-`d`-`c`-`b`-`g`-`l`-`q`-`v`-`SP`-OK = 9
* W => `SP`-`aA`-OK-`SP`-`V`-`W`-OK = 6
* a => `W`-`V`-`U`-`aA`-OK-`u`-`p`-`k`-`f`-`a`-OK = 10
* r => `a`-`f`-`k`-`p`-`q`-`r`-OK = 6
* s => `r`-`s`-OK = 2

Answer = 14 + 16 + 4 + 2 + 9 + 6 + 10 + 6 + 2 = 69



*Good Luck!
