You have been presented with a cipher, your goal is to re-create the cipher with little information. Use the examples provided to see if you can find a solution to how this cipher is made. You will be given no hints, only the handful of phrases that have already been deciphered for you. 

Your only hint: Spaces are left alone, they are not altered in any way. Anytime there is a space, it should remain untouched and in place.

I hope you enjoy, but this one should be genuinely infuriating.
