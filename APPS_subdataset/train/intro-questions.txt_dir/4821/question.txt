Task:
This kata requires you to write an object that receives a file path 
and does operations on it.
NOTE FOR PYTHON USERS: You cannot use modules os.path, glob, and re
The purpose of this kata is to use string parsing, so you're not supposed to import external libraries. I could only enforce this in python.
Testing:

Python:
```python
>>> master = FileMaster('/Users/person1/Pictures/house.png')
>>> master.extension()
'png'
>>> master.filename()
'house'
>>> master.dirpath()
'/Users/person1/Pictures/'
```
