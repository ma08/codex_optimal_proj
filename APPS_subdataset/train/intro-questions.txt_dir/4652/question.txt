Given a number `n` we will define its scORe to be `0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | ... | n`, where `|` is the [bitwise OR operator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#OR).

Write a function that takes `n` and finds its scORe.

---------------------
|    n    | scORe n |
|---------|-------- |       
| 0       | 0 |
| 1       | 1 |
| 49      | 63 |
| 1000000 | 1048575 |
