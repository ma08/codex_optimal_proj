DO YOU EXPECT ME TO FIND THIS OUT?

WHAT BASE AND/XOR LANGUAGE INCLUDES string?

DON'T BYTE OF MORE THAN YOU CAN CHEW

YOU CAN ONLY DISTORT THE LARGEST OF MATHEMATICS SO FAR

SAYING "ABRACADABRA" WITHOUT A MAGIC AND WON'T DO YOU ANY GOOD

THE LAST STACK RUPTURES. ALL DIE. OH, THE EMBARRASSMENT!

I HAVE NO ARRAY AND I MUST SCREAM

ELEMENTS MAY NOT BE STORED IN WEST HYPERSPACE
