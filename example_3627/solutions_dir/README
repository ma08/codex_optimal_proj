in this example, first I test the functional correctness of one of the solutions provided in the dataset, then I try some of the results outputted by codex with code-davicni 1 and temperature=0, and topP=1. so far non of these work, but this is coherent with what mentioned in different papers , where they say that pre-trained codex has not very high numbers wiht pass@1 metric even for introductory problems (pag 8 paper human_eval). so we expect that even for problems like this, non fine-tuned codex might output correct implementation after several attempts (with T!=0 possibly)
