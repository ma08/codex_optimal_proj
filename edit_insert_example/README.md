This folder shows a basic example of how to run the Edit/Insert API feature on a given input code.
In particular:  
-`example_code.txt`: file containing the input code for the Edit API (in this case, previously generated by a Completion operation). This code constains the following 4 syntax errors:  
  -1 minor error in the function name "arrys"  
  -"arrr2"  
  -"np.argsrt"  
  -"knd"  
-`example.py`: script for launching the Edit operation and save the results. In this specific example the Edit parameters were set to be (T=0.5,n=3).  
-`output.txt` : results obtained for this experiment: The first 2 solutions are identical and fix 3 out of 4 errors (the one not fixed is not a real error and does not affect functionality). The third solution, on the other hand, is just fixing two errors, neglecting the spelling mistake "arrr2".
