# Configuration files folder
- Though the folder is located here, most of the times files are copy pasted to the parent directory of local scripts and used for convenience
- Right now only OpenAI API keys are the configuration
- Not putting the API keys in the repo but adding a template file `API_keys_template.config` which should be renamed as `API_keys.config` with the right keys in the relevant folder
