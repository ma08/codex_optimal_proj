in this example, we have a code with 4 syntax errors: 
-1 minor error in the function name "arrys"
-"arrr2"
-"np.argsrt"
-"knd"

by generating 3 solutions(n=3) with temperature T=0.5, we can see some variance in the outputs. The first 2 solutions are identical and fix 3 out of 4 errors ( the one not fixed is not a real error and does not affect functionality). The third solution, on the other hand, is just fixing two errors, neglecting "arrr2".
